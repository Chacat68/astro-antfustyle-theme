## Preface

Time always flows silently. The May Day holiday arrived as scheduled, and I gradually relaxed from my busy state, as if the gears of time had slowed down a bit. I arranged a few meals, shared tea, and enjoyed a few small drinks together. The tangible feeling of life quietly returned in these simple gatherings.

At street-side food stalls and over drinks, we shared freely, talking about the current struggles and joys in each of our lives.

## Tea Time

Back in Guangzhou, the first habit I revived was meeting old friends for tea. When the mood struck, we would head out together to a teahouse, order a few favorite dim sum and small dishes, sit around a table, and chat about everyday life.

The teahouse near my home, while its dishes are nothing extraordinary, has the advantage of being open 24/7. Whenever the craving hits, you can always find a seat. Congee and rice noodle rolls are never disappointing choices. This time, I also tried fish skin for the first time—its crispy texture and delicious flavor were a delightful surprise.

## Drinks

A few days later, a friend extended another invitation, this time for a casual drink. We planned to meet at a bar by the river. Just as we arrived, the sky suddenly turned dark, and a downpour began as if on cue. We hurriedly took shelter in an unassuming eatery by the pier. This accidental choice turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

We chose a table by the edge. As we chatted, the rain grew heavier. The restaurant lowered the partition curtains, and through them, we could see the rain falling on the river. The wind and rain dispelled the summer's stifling heat. We ordered a few small dishes and began to raise our glasses.

After a few drinks, the nerves that had been tense before the holiday gradually eased. Everyone started talking about their own lives, venting about work frustrations, inevitably sharing views on the environment, and discussing some changes they had made in their lives.

After the rain stopped, we took a walk along the river, enjoying the breeze and savoring the present moment.

## Late-Night Snack

On an ordinary evening, I was at home wrestling with bugs in AI-generated code when I suddenly received a message from an old friend. I put down my work, took a taxi to his place, and we walked together to a nearby time-honored restaurant, planning to have an authentic Chaoshan claypot porridge to soothe our tired bodies and minds.

While ordering, the owner enthusiastically recommended their signature dish, **[Deep-Fried Fresh Squid]**. One bite was enough—the crispy exterior and tender, flavorful flesh instantly won over our taste buds, leaving a lasting impression.

Next, the savory seafood porridge and the crisp stir-fried Chinese broccoli also comforted our stomachs. Our conversation ranged from life's trivialities to work challenges and shared complaints about life's annoyances—we talked about everything. After the meal, we decided to take a walk to aid digestion, strolling back to his place along familiar yet somewhat changed streets.

Along the way, the city's transformations unfolded before our eyes. A once-familiar bar had turned into a literary café, and a former alley had become a refined park. The passage of time was truly poignant.

## Farewell

These days of gathering brought the joy of reuniting with old friends. They added a tangible sense of reality to my life and made me cherish our bond even more. In this uncertain world, our friendship of over a decade is truly precious.

I hope that in the next 10 years, we can still gather like this.

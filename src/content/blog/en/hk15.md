## Preface

Among the many classic works in the Chinese music scene, some songs can instantly strike the softest part of the heart. In 2014, Hins Cheung's release of "Youth Eternal" was precisely such a work. This song, with lyrics by Wyman Wong and composed by Hins Cheung and Johnny Yim together, not only became the lead single for Hins Cheung's first album *Morph* after joining Emperor Entertainment Group, but its live duet version with Tam Yuk Ying during that year's concert also moved countless audiences.

"Doraemon, please don't grow old, stay with me as I grow taller" — this opening lyric instantly transports listeners back to that innocent childhood era. Starting from childhood memories, the song expresses helplessness against the passage of time and a longing for beautiful things to last forever, striking a chord with an entire generation.

## The Song

### Lyrics

```
Doraemon, please don't grow old
Stay with me as I grow taller
Saint Seiya, please don't grow old
Stay with me as I fight my battles
Even as a child, I knew early on
The taste of the truth
Yet I longed for perfection, to defy fate
All my idols standing tall forever
Mom and Dad forever safe and sound
Best of all, the faces I care about
Would never age

Why is it that while wandering
While playing, we suddenly grow old
We agree on something
But by the time it can be fulfilled, you're already asleep
Praying for old friends to live forever
Old loves to last forever, don't just grow old
Time, this villain
Is so utterly relentless
Not even allowing a moment's pause

Fong Fong, please don't grow old, lead the trend once more
Ka Ka, please don't grow old, reach new heights
Life, in a daze, has brought me to this point
I can only rely on you to remind me I'm not old yet
How wonderful those years were
Why can't I encounter them again
Those who have already turned gray
Seem to be making a silent accusation

Why is it that while wandering
While playing, we suddenly grow old
We agree on something
But by the time it can be fulfilled, you're already asleep
Praying for old friends to live forever
Old loves to last forever, don't just grow old
Time, this villain
Is so utterly heartless
Not even allowing a slower departure

Why is it that while wandering
While playing, we suddenly grow old
We agree on something
But by the time it can be fulfilled, you're already asleep
Praying for old friends to live forever
Old loves to last forever, don't just grow old
Time, this villain
Is so utterly heartless
Not even allowing a slower departure
```

## Significance of the Era

It is worth mentioning that Hins Cheung has stated at multiple award ceremonies that singing "Youth Eternal" makes him think of the Hong Kong voice actor for Doraemon, Bo-Chuen Lam. On January 2, 2015, Bo-Chuen Lam passed away due to illness. Hins Cheung wrote a tribute on Instagram, quoting the song's first line, "Doraemon, please don't grow old, stay with me as I grow taller," which resonated deeply once again. The song re-entered the Commercial Radio Ultimate Song Chart in the second week of 2015, a rare occurrence.

"Youth Eternal" is more than just a song; it is a collective memory and emotional anchor for a generation. It sings of the complex feelings of those born in the 80s and 90s as they face growth and the passage of time — nostalgia for the beautiful days of childhood, reluctant acceptance of reality's helplessness, and a gentle hope for the future.

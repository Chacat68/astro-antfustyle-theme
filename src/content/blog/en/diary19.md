## The Beginning

Life has been somewhat reclusive lately, with most of my time spent on daily life and work. Outside of work, what I enjoy most is reading and listening to podcasts. It feels like fiddling with a radio as a child, tuning in to find radio programs—full of fun.

Since I've grown less fond of browsing social media, podcasts and RSS have become my main channels for obtaining information. All the valuable insights this year have essentially come through these two channels.

The advantage of these channels is that they can provide valuable content in very niche areas.

Another benefit of podcasts is that they don't interfere with tasks. I often turn on podcasts while doing chores, showering, or running, making the whole process much less boring. Listening to the hosts' voices, I feel a slight connection to the distant world.

Over the years, I've gradually realized that while social media is convenient, it often brings information overload and fragmentation. Podcasts and RSS subscriptions are different; they not only offer more in-depth and insightful content but also allow me to better control the quality and pace of the information I consume.

## Preface

On the journey of life, there exists an invisible force capable of quietly altering our destinies. It requires no magic, no superpowers; it lies hidden in the way we view the world and others, and in the simple phrase "I believe in you" that we offer to ourselves and others. When you hear "You can do it," do you feel a subtle yet tangible surge of energy within? This is the charm of the expectation effect—a simple, well-documented psychological principle proven to change behavior and outcomes.

## A Psychological Phenomenon That Changes Fate

The expectation effect, also known as the Pygmalion effect or Rosenthal effect, posits that one person's expectations of another can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the simplest terms: if you're told you can, you're more likely to succeed; if you're told you can't, you're more likely to fail. This isn't just motivational talk; it's a principle backed by numerous experiments and real-world observations. Through a series of rigorous studies, American psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Edith Jacobson revealed a startling truth: our expectations subtly change how we treat others, and this change, in turn, shapes their performance and reality.

## The Secret of the Smart Mice

Rosenthal selected a group of similar-sized, similar-aged white mice and randomly divided them into two groups, assigning them to different experimenters to train them to navigate a maze. Before training began, he told the experimenters: one group of mice was highly intelligent and would perform excellently; the other group was of average intelligence and would require extra effort. The results soon confirmed the "prediction": the group labeled "smart" navigated the maze faster, while the "average" group performed significantly slower.

The real secret, however, lay behind the labels—the mice were randomly assigned, with no inherent intelligence difference. The difference stemmed from human expectation. Once experimenters believed "these mice are smart," they became more patient, meticulous, encouraging, and invested in training, unconsciously creating more favorable practice conditions and interactive atmospheres for the mice. Expectations changed behavior, behavior changed outcomes, and the outcomes, in turn, "proved" the expectations correct.

## An Educational Miracle in the Classroom

More significant in real-world terms was the experiment conducted at Oak School. Rosenthal and Jacobson selected classes from various grades and, at the start of the school year, randomly chose some students, informing their teachers that these were "the students with the most growth potential." Eight months later, the test results were astonishing: the children on the "potential list" showed significant improvement in academic performance, became more outgoing and confident, adopted a more proactive learning attitude, and engaged more frequently and positively with their teachers.

The root of all this was simply the teachers' expectations. When teachers genuinely believed a student had greater potential, every detail in the classroom changed accordingly: more opportunities to answer questions, more detailed guidance, more timely encouragement, more specific recognition, and clearer, more expectant demands. From these subtle yet consistent interactions, students gradually formed more positive self-perceptions and responded to this trust and expectation with genuine effort.

## The Mechanism of the Expectation Effect

The expectation effect typically follows a clear cycle. First is the formation of expectation—the expecter develops positive aspirations and specific goal imagery for the expected person. Next is the translation into action—the expecter expresses trust, offers support, and creates opportunities through words and deeds. Then comes the perception and acceptance of attention by the expected person—they sense this goodwill and demand and are willing to try to respond. Finally, potential is unlocked and results manifest—through responding to the expectation, performance improves, and the outcomes validate the initial expectation. Once this cycle is established, it continuously influences the trajectory of the individual and the relationship.

## Practical Wisdom in Modern Life

### Application in Education

As parents, our task is to transform the phrase "I believe in you" into concrete, ongoing companionship. Shift the focus from single outcomes to the growth process, replace criticism with encouragement, and substitute doubt with trust, allowing children to actively explore their potential in an atmosphere of being seen and understood. As teachers, maintain sincere expectations and patience for every student, avoid negative fixed labels, and let the classroom, with appropriate challenges and timely support, become a space where children experience success and build confidence.

### Application in the Workplace

As managers, positive and clear expectations provide direction and energy for the team: express trust, create genuine growth opportunities, offer specific positive feedback promptly, and help members identify and develop their strengths. As colleagues, be willing to trust each other's professional abilities, base collaboration on support and encouragement, share positive beliefs, foster an uplifting collaborative atmosphere, and make "We can do it" the team's default language.

### Clever Use in Interpersonal Relationships

In friendships, trust and encouragement can help friends see possibilities they hadn't discovered, becoming a source of support and companionship at critical moments. In family relationships, unconditional love and steadfast support are the deepest expressions of expectation, empowering family members to continue pursuing and trying even in the face of setbacks. Expectations in relationships should not be pressure but nourishment—a gentle invitation to each other's potential.

## Applying the Expectation Effect to Yourself

Most importantly, we must learn to hold positive expectations for ourselves. Believe in your own potential, set clear and achievable goals, view skill development with a growth mindset, and give yourself recognition and rewards for every small step of progress. These actions can turn "I can" into a tangible, cumulative reality. Specific practices can be very down-to-earth: start the day with an affirmation each morning; reduce self-criticism and increase encouragement in your internal dialogue; regularly visualize successful scenarios in your mind; and periodically record achievements and progress, making growth something you can look back on and see.

## Applying the Expectation Effect in the Digital Age

The flood of information can easily drown out individual voices. Learn to choose positive and inspiring information sources, avoid defining yourself with negative labels, proactively build supportive networks, walk alongside those willing to encourage each other, and use your own strength to spread constructive energy. These are concrete ways to bring the expectation effect into digital life. On social media, offer more sincere likes and recognition, share genuine efforts and successes, reject bullying and negativity, and approach differing opinions with empathy and constructive feedback, making public spaces fertile ground for sowing positive expectations.

## Considerations and Balance

While the power of expectation is strong, rationality is equally important. Unrealistically high expectations only bring pressure and disappointment. Respect individual differences, allow for different paces and styles of growth, leave room for adjustment and trial and error for yourself and others, and maintain patience and perseverance for long-term change—these are prerequisites for making expectation a positive force. Also remember that sincerity is fundamental. False expectations are easily detected and only cause harm; words must align with actions, and support must be perceptible and experiential. The true posture that matches expectation and growth is the ability to accept and start anew in the face of failure and setbacks.

## Conclusion: The Power of Expectation

The expectation effect reveals a simple truth powerful enough to change life trajectories: what you expect, you often attract; what you believe, you often create. Our expectations are conveyed to others through countless subtle words and actions, influencing their self-perception and direction of effort, ultimately shaping the reality we co-create. Let us view our own and others' potential with a positive lens, use sincere trust to ignite the inner energy of those around us, use steadfast and warm encouragement to light each other's hopes, and make "You can, I can, we can" the most natural expression in our lives.

Believing you can makes you can—not because of empty slogans, but because the power of expectation truly can change everything.

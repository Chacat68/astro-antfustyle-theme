Life, thin and light-off time and time again

Life, slight and frivolous time and again

Frivolous tireless

Restlessly frivolous, never tiring

I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart

I hear the echo, from the valleys and the heart

Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting

Harvesting the empty soul with a lonely sickle

Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of eventually swaying in the desert oasis

Repeating resolutely, yet also repeating happiness, until an oasis sways in the desert

I believe I am

I believe I am

Born as the bright summer flowers

Born as the brilliant summer flowers

Do not withered undefeated fiery demon rule

Unwilting, undefeated, a fiery demon's rule

Heart rate and breathing to bear the load of the cumbersome Bored

Bearing the burden of heartbeat and the weariness of breath, yet never wearying of it

I heard the music, from the moon and carcass

I hear the music, from the moon and the body

Auxiliary extreme aestheticism bait to capture misty

Aiding with extreme aesthetic bait to capture the elusive beauty

Filling the intense life, but also filling the pure

Filling an intense life, yet also filling it with purity

There are always memories throughout the earth

Memories always permeate the world

I believe I am

I believe I am

Died as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves

To die as the quiet beauty of autumn leaves

Sheng is not chaos, smoke gesture

Neither flourishing nor chaotic, a posture like smoke

Even wilt also retained bone proudly Qing Feng muscle Occult

Even in withering, retaining the proud bones and clear sinews, mysterious and profound

I hear love, I believe in love

I hear love, I believe in love

Love is a pool of struggling blue-green algae

Love is a pond of struggling blue-green algae

As desolate micro-burst of wind

Like a desolate, faint gust of wind

Bleeding through my veins

Bleeding through my veins

Years stationed in the belief

Years stationed in belief

I believe that all can hear

I believe all can be heard

Even anticipate discrete, I met the other their own

Even anticipating separation, I meet another self

Some can not grasp the moment

Some moments cannot be grasped

Left to the East to go West, the dead must not return to nowhere

Left to wander east and west, what is gone will never return

See, I wear Zan Flowers on my head, in full bloom along the way all the way

See, I wear flowers in my hair, blooming all along the way

Frequently missed some, but also deeply moved by wind, frost, snow or rain

Frequently missing some, yet deeply moved by wind, frost, snow, or rain

Prajna Paramita, soon as soon as life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves

Prajna Paramita, moment by moment, life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves

Also care about what has

Still care about what one possesses

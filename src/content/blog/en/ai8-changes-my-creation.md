> Lately, artificial intelligence has quietly integrated into my creative workflow. From writing to game development, it's changing how I think and work.

## A Shift in Writing Approach

In the past, I would often stare at a blank document, ideas swirling in my head but unsure where to begin. That feeling of "the first step is the hardest" is something I'm sure many can relate to.

Now, it's different. I start by conversing with an AI, articulating the scattered thoughts in my mind and letting it generate a draft for me. This draft might be rough, but it at least gives me a starting point. Then, I revise and polish it, infusing it with my own emotions and reflections, giving the words warmth.

This approach has made writing much easier. The AI acts like a patient assistant, helping me with the most difficult part—going from "0 to 1"—while I focus on refining it from "1 to 100." The barrier to creation has lowered, yet the space for expression has actually expanded.

AI has accelerated my creative efficiency, giving me more time to contemplate the themes, scope, and depth of my content. Articles that might have been hastily finished due to time constraints before can now be polished with greater care, making the work more valuable.

It has also freed me from the heavy burden of writing tasks, allowing me more energy to explore new subjects and styles, experiment with different forms of expression, and diversify my creative output.

## New Perspectives on Game Creation

When making games, assets have always been a headache. In the past, I often had to wait for artists to create them, which involved high communication costs and long cycles. Sometimes, I had a clear image in my mind but struggled to convey it accurately to others.

Now, I first use AI to generate an image, visualizing my ideas. While these images might not be polished, they are sufficient to convey the atmosphere and style I'm aiming for. With this foundation, I can then collaborate with artists to iterate and refine, significantly improving communication efficiency.

This approach has transformed me from a "waiter" into a "creator." I'm no longer just describing requirements; I can actively participate in the visual creation process. That sense of control makes the entire development process much smoother.

AI has also provided new ideas for game design. Through conversations with AI, I can quickly generate various settings and plot frameworks, sparking more creativity. It's like an endless source of inspiration, always ready to offer fresh ideas.

Moreover, AI-generated content often includes unexpected elements, breaking my habitual thought patterns and pushing me out of my comfort zone to try more innovative designs.

## Tools and the Creator

Some say AI will replace creators, but I'm not so sure. No matter how powerful a tool is, it remains just a tool. It can help you sketch an outline, but it can't draw the story in your heart; it can help you write sentences, but it can't capture your unique insights.

AI changes the *way* we create, not the *essence* of creation. The things that truly move people still require creators to feel, think, and express with genuine care.

I've gradually realized that AI gives me more time to polish what truly matters. It handles the tedious groundwork, allowing me to focus on making the work better.

At the beginning of 2022, the pandemic was still raging. This disaster, which had lasted for two years, disrupted my normal life and changed my way of working. It made me rethink what is more important to me.

During the Spring Festival holiday, I finally managed to adjust my physical and mental state. I tried organizing the photos I had taken, writing more articles, and deleting posts from my blog that I felt were not well-written. I repositioned my blog, aiming to raise the quality standards for my articles.

I used the UE engine to create my first test level, going through various aspects like models, materials, animations, effects, and lighting. I now have a better understanding of these elements.

After all this tinkering, the concepts of [producer] and [consumer] came to mind again. Deep down, I still see myself in the role of a producer. After a series of experiences this year, in 2022, I plan to allocate more energy to honing my creative abilities.

After testing UE5, I feel that productivity in the coming years will skyrocket. With UE, I can do much more, and I’m starting to look beyond the gaming industry, striving to explore this direction further.

Making games, writing blog posts, programming, and designing are all forms of production for me. I make a living from game development, while blogging and design are hobbies that help me maintain my ability to create continuously. In 2022, I’ll ramp up my programming efforts—partly to master the tools and partly to improve my English skills.

I’m reducing my intake of information content and trimming down the channels through which I consume it, hoping to find more in-depth and valuable content, such as the "Product Meditation" curated by Teacher Shaonan. I’ve started using email and RSS tools to gather information, trying to slow down the flow of information so that my thoughts don’t have to rush. In this context, "slow is fast" makes perfect sense.

The value of creating content made me very happy during the holiday period. I want to keep embracing this feeling. This year, I aim to meet more new friends and experience more fresh things to keep my creativity vibrant.

I need to avoid unreasonable working hours and maintain my physical and mental health. Let’s keep pushing forward in 2022!

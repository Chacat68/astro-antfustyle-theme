> Hong Kong Music Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs where light and shadow intertwined, recording unforgettable melodies in my heart, sharing stories of Hong Kong music, be it popular or niche.

Recently saw Fiona Sit on "Sisters Who Make Waves 3". She is one of my favorite Cantonese female singers. Dubbed as Hong Kong's last sweetheart, her personality is quirky and endearing.

### "Keanu Reeves' Reply"

Back in the day, in the Hong Kong and Taiwan music scene, there was a trend of writing lyrics as short theatrical vignettes. This song is a classic example. The lyrics describe a Miss F writing a letter to Keanu Reeves and receiving his reply. I believe this song is also the first one through which many people got to know Fiona Sit.

### "To Me in Ten Years"

Have the things you've done over the past ten years left you with no regrets and pride? Have the things you believed in back then remained unshaken?
The lyrics of this song echo in my mind on countless nights. Whenever such moments arise, I seek out this song and listen to it again.

### "All the Rainy Days"

"Because I spent a rainy day with you, even watching the rain alone feels a bit more pleasant now." This is a song with a very soothing melody, perfect for an ordinary rainy day. Listen as this girl sings you her story about rainy days.

### "That Version of Me"

This song tells a story about a girl growing into a woman. The music video uses extensive paint-splashing visual effects.

## "Me in Ten Years"

"How to spend what remains, should I bargain for what I don't yet have, is the heart still unsettled?" This song is a look back from ten years later, compared to the self from ten years ago who was full of hope for the future. Is the self ten years later satisfied with the present?

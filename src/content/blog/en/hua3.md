> Chinese Collection: Recording the Chinese music that accompanied my growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

Anpu is a singer I deeply admire. Her interpretation of life and songs influenced me greatly in my youth. Recently, I stumbled upon her video for "About I Love You" on YouTube and found it very moving, so I decided to share it with you all.

In my younger days, I understood the lyrics of this song as longing for a lover, but now I feel it's more about longing for oneself.

## Lyrics:

---

All you long for has departed
You've asked yourself countless times, wanting to give up
Everything is right here before your eyes
Detachment and pursuit are often mixed together

What you embrace does not always embrace you
And what I want to say; no one is regrettable
To squander and to cherish are the same thing

All that I have, why not, why must
How honored I am

Before we must realize we will ultimately have nothing
At least you can say
I understand, living is the loneliest
All I have is by chance
All I've lost is life
When you neither forget nor dwell on the past
I love you

All you long for has departed
You've asked yourself countless times, wanting to give up
Everything is right here before your eyes
Detachment and pursuit are often mixed together

What you embrace does not always embrace you
And what I want to say; no one is regrettable
To squander and to cherish are the same thing

All that I have, why not, why must
How honored I am

Before we must realize we will ultimately have nothing
At least you can say
I understand, living is the loneliest
All I have is by chance
All I've lost is life
When you neither forget nor dwell on the past
I love you

Before we must feel we will ultimately have nothing
What you do allows you to say
Yes, I have seen my dream
All I have is by chance
All I've lost is life

Because what you worry about is yourself
I love you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I love you
I love you

> Mandarin Collection: Documenting the Mandarin music that accompanied our growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

The first listen to Cyndi Wang's "Deep Slumber" is like slowly waking from a half-dream—the song lacks a hurried tempo, yet with layered textures and delicate arrangement, it gradually guides you into a psychological space of forgetting, reflection, and redemption. Unlike the agility and vitality in Cyndi's past works, "Deep Slumber" reveals a deeper musical exploration: within her low, magnetic voice lies a gentle inquiry into growth, the passage of time, and self-awareness.

The lyrics use the poetic imagery of "deep slumber"—both literal deep sleep and metaphorical numbness, forgetting, and spiritual rest—to explore the overlooked details, the ignored voices in life, and how, under the weight of life's pressures, we can rediscover our own clarity and strength. Thus, this song becomes a dialogue with the inner self: within the murmurs of deep slumber, how many true selves are calling us back.

## Lyrics

**Deep Slumber**

Thank him for treating me like a fool
Deceiving me every day, once more
Being clear-headed for a lifetime is just like that
I don't mind using love to live in a drunken dream
So being hypnotized is truly interesting
I'm happy to be a dedicated hostage
No time left to explain to anyone
It was I who held myself captive
It has nothing to do with him
I've almost forgotten how to love someone
My wasted youth might still come back to life
Those who say they pity me should understand better
Of course, I will indulge to my heart's content
Just let me accompany him to finish this love
Only hoping the heart's flower finally blooms, then I have no other expectations
Wait until the dream ends and I wake, then go clean up the remnants

So being hypnotized is truly interesting
I'm happy to be a dedicated hostage
No time left to explain to anyone
It was I who held myself captive
It has nothing to do with him
I've almost forgotten how to love someone
My wasted youth might still come back to life
Those who say they pity me should understand better
Of course, I will indulge to my heart's content
Just let me accompany him to finish this love
Only hoping the heart's flower finally blooms, then I have no other expectations
Wait until the dream ends and I wake, then go clean up the remnants
If we don't lose our senses
Where does love begin?
A silly liar and a lying fool
Might possibly last a lifetime
I've almost forgotten how to love someone
My wasted youth might still come back to life
Those who say they pity me should understand better
Of course, I will indulge to my heart's content
Just let me accompany him to finish this love
Only hoping the heart's flower finally blooms, then I have no other expectations
Wait until the dream ends and I wake, then go clean up the remnants

## About This Song

Recently, something interesting happened. My long-running Factorio save file crashed because the coal resources ran out, causing the entire power system to collapse. During my playthrough, I had chosen technologies too aggressively, switching weapons, transportation, and other components to electric power. As a result, everything came to a complete halt. And just at that moment, a massive wave of biters charged in, creating a scenario where I had to solve the problem before they arrived.

The funniest part is that my last manual save was 10 minutes earlier. All other saves were automatic, taken at various points within those 10 minutes. I tried jumping back to those saves and putting in effort, but I couldn’t solve the core issue of coal depletion.

After accepting this reality, I reflected on the entire gameplay process. Several warning signs leading to the final collapse had appeared long ago, but I hadn’t properly sorted them out or thought about how to improve them. There were too many painful and troublesome issues along the way, and eventually, all these factors converged at this moment, leading to the ultimate crash.

The whole process:

1. This save file was my first time reaching this stage of progress. Many buildings were constructed in an unreasonable way from the start, making them particularly troublesome to dismantle. I could only patch things up and manually transport resources. By the late game, I was essentially a human porter.
2. The pursuit of quick and effective results seems ingrained in my genes. I ignored problems along the way and never resolved to replan, constantly procrastinating until everything exploded!
3. I never took the time to thoroughly assess whether resources were allocated reasonably. Resources couldn’t form a sustainable cycle, and by the late game, I was almost entirely relying on personal time consumption to solve problems.

After cursing myself as an idiot... I happily started a new game. This time, I addressed the issues mentioned above, and the gaming experience felt completely different. It shifted from "I must do something right now to solve the problem" to "Let’s review what happened today and plan what to do tomorrow." Calculating the time, it seemed reasonable—time to get to work!

Actually, the problem wasn’t as big as I imagined! When it comes to gaming, the most important thing is to have fun!

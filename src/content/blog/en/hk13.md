## Preface

In the world of love, we have all experienced such moments: the person who was once the most important can only appear as a "guest" at the other's significant life events. That sense of distance, that feeling of alienation, is more cruel than any words.

Yet, it is precisely this regret that makes love more precious. It is precisely this distance that makes longing more profound. "Guest" tells the most painful story in the gentlest way, and comforts every wounded heart with the most beautiful melody.

It turns out forgetting love isn't so easy
The delivery address I always fill in
Is always your residence
Like a child's scribbles, so childish
Never admitting my mistakes
How I miss you, you don't know
You told me about the wedding over the phone
And even invited me to attend
Let me quietly watch you
Willingly put on the wedding dress for him
Like a good friend being your guest
Abiding by the agonizing duty
That old love hidden in the wedding invitation, still causing aftershocks
Memories remind me how lucky I once was
To have kissed you passionately on the long street
But this moment, that kiss transferred to him
Tears my heart apart
Why have I become a guest
Wishing you happiness and stability
I will embrace regret for the rest of my life
From now on, secretly missing you but unable to get close
My tears force themselves back but still seep through
In your wedding dress, you are so captivating
To illustrate how well-suited he and you are

You've taken on his surname
Your vow is "I do"
It pierces through my infatuation
The story we once dreamed of together
Is now a moving irony
He finally took my place
You told me about the wedding over the phone
And even invited me to attend
Let me quietly watch you
Fortunately finding the one you desire
Like a good friend being your guest
Abiding by the agonizing duty
That old love hidden in the wedding invitation, still causing aftershocks
Memories remind me how lucky I once was
To have kissed you passionately on the long street
But this moment, that kiss transferred to him
Tears my heart apart
Why have I become a guest
Wishing you happiness and stability
I will embrace regret for the rest of my life
From now on, secretly missing you but unable to get close
My tears force themselves back but still seep through
In your wedding dress, you are so captivating
To illustrate how perfectly suited he and you are

The sound of applause fills the room
And from now on, he and you become the perfect match
No time to spare pity for someone else
How could I ever be your guest
I simply don't have the talent for it
This love has been hidden from the start, still causing aftershocks
In my memories, I was once so fortunate
Loving you like an unsolvable addiction
But this moment, that kiss transferred to him
Makes the wound cut even deeper
So I have become a guest
I earnestly wish you happiness and stability
I will embrace regret for the rest of my life
From now on, secretly missing you but unable to get close
In this life, no fate remains to wait for
In your wedding dress, you are so captivating
To illustrate how perfectly suited he and you are
Watching you hold his hand, hearts as one
To illustrate how much more suited he is than I

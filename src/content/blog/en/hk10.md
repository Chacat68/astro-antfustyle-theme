## Foreword

Liu Xijun and Lam Hiu Fung's duet of "Modern Love Story" was undoubtedly the highlight of the show. It must be said that Lam Hiu Fung's voice is incredibly impactful, especially when singing in the lower register—not only is the tone beautiful, but the emotion is also genuine. This is truly a gift. Liu Xijun's voice has always been her greatest strength, possessing not only high recognizability but also a captivating quality. What's even more remarkable is that no one can imitate it—that harmonically rich tone is rare even among top-tier singers. Their collaboration was seamless and absolutely delightful to listen to!

## Lyrics of "Modern Love Story"

Parting isn't right or wrong
No need for much explanation when leaving
In modern times, talking about forever is foolish
With that night gone, the spark has faded
It's impossible to give a lifetime so much

When love ends, one must let go
How could I want to pierce my heart
If tired of it, don't linger anymore
If we part, there should be a chance to love another
It's impossible to spend a lifetime in emptiness

Our love is like a path half-traveled
Deeply knowing that loving again will bring much pain
I hope you can let me go lightly and easily
Leave me with some happy memories to send me off
All because after understanding, we see clearly

When parting, smile; tomorrow morning I'll be alone
Even in my carefree moments, I'll remember the beginning

If your heart feels lonely, come find me again
If your heart feels empty, come find me again
No need to suffer when you think of me

Parting isn't right or wrong
No need for much explanation when leaving
In modern times, talking about forever is foolish
With that night gone, the spark has faded
It's impossible to give a lifetime so much

When love ends, one must let go
How could I want to pierce my heart
If tired of it, don't linger anymore
If we part, there should be a chance to love another
It's impossible to spend a lifetime in emptiness

Our love is like a path half-traveled
Deeply knowing that loving again will bring much pain
I hope you can let me go lightly and easily
Leave me with some happy memories to send me off
All because after understanding, we see clearly

When parting, smile; tomorrow morning I'll be alone
Even in my carefree moments, I'll remember the beginning

If your heart feels lonely, come find me again
If your heart feels empty, come find me again
No need to suffer when you think of me

Our love is like a path half-traveled
Deeply knowing that loving again will bring much pain
I hope you can let me go lightly and easily
Leave me with some happy memories to send me off
All because after understanding, we see clearly
When parting, smile; tomorrow morning I'll be alone
Even in my carefree moments, I'll remember the beginning

If your heart feels lonely, come find me again
If your heart feels empty, come find me again
No need to suffer when you think of me

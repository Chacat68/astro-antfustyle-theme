## Introduction

> Human talent is like a muscle; it needs continuous exercise to grow.

In this era of rapid change, as new things surge in like a tide, we need to ask ourselves: from what perspective should we examine them to maximize the discovery and utilization of these new resources? I believe a growth mindset is precisely that sharp tool. It can not only cut through the heavy fog of fixed thinking outwardly but also deeply sculpt our minds inwardly, allowing us to find the power to grow amidst change.

## What is a Growth Mindset?

I first encountered the concept of a growth mindset in Mr. Gu Dian's book *Breaking Down the Walls in Our Minds*. I began to realize that the thinking patterns I had learned since childhood weren't necessarily correct; they could be changed.

Later, upon learning about Professor Carol Dweck's research and seeing more and more people I respect endorsing the concept of a growth mindset, I started practicing it in my life and found it truly effective. Gradually, I began to break down the walls in my own mind.

After embracing a growth mindset, my attitude underwent a significant shift. I started viewing difficulties as excellent opportunities to exercise my brain, much like going to the gym to work out muscles. Every challenge made me stronger.

I no longer focused solely on whether the outcome was good or bad but instead began to cherish the process of effort itself. What benefited me most was learning to actively seek others' opinions and suggestions, treating their feedback as precious gifts to help me grow, rather than as criticism or attacks.

## How to Cultivate a Growth Mindset?

To be honest, transitioning from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is by no means an overnight process. It took me a long time to gradually figure it out. This process requires a lot of practice and constant self-reflection.

In my practice, I found that cultivating a growth mindset is like learning a completely new skill; it requires effort from multiple dimensions simultaneously. At the very beginning, I had to honestly acknowledge a fact: we all occasionally fall into the trap of a fixed mindset, and that's completely normal. Recognizing this is actually the first step toward change. Next, I began consciously adjusting my internal dialogue. For example, when I wanted to say "I can't," I would remind myself to say "I can't yet"; when I wanted to say "I failed," I would tell myself "I learned a valuable lesson."

I also developed the habit of keeping a reflection journal, meticulously recording my daily learning process and inner feelings. This habit helped shift my focus from "How well did I perform today?" to "What new thing did I learn today?" What excites me most is that I started actively seeking challenges and bravely stepping out of my comfort zone. I imagine this process like playing an RPG game, where every small breakthrough feels like gaining experience points, making me stronger in the game of life.

## Practical Applications of a Growth Mindset

Having talked so much about theory, let me share some real-life examples from my own experience to see how a growth mindset works its magic in my life.

I remember when I first started learning to code, two types of thinking were fiercely battling in my mind. The voice of the fixed mindset told me: "You're already this age and have no programming foundation; it's simply impossible to learn." But the growth mindset made me think from a different angle: "Even though I can't write a single line of code now, as long as I practice consistently every day, I can definitely master this skill." In the end, I chose to believe the latter. After several months of effort, I really wrote my first small program.

At work, I also deeply felt the huge difference between these two mindsets. Once, a project I was responsible for completely failed. At that time, my heart was filled with self-doubt: "Am I really not suited for this job?" But soon, I adjusted my mindset and began reflecting: "What exactly did this failure teach me? How should I avoid making the same mistake next time?" It was precisely this way of thinking that allowed me to draw valuable lessons from failure instead of being crushed by the setback.

In terms of interpersonal relationships, the growth mindset changed how I interact with others even more. In the past, when friends offered critical opinions, I would subconsciously think, "He just doesn't like me." Now, I actively consider: "Maybe he has a point; I could indeed do better in some areas." This open-minded attitude has not only helped me gain more genuine friendships but also made me more mature in my social interactions.

## Changes Brought by a Growth Mindset

When I truly started persistently cultivating a growth mindset, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my life had undergone earth-shaking changes. I no longer feared failure as I used to because I deeply understood that every fall was accumulating valuable experience for the next success.

I also shifted my focus from others back to myself, thinking about how to become a better version of me. I no longer focused solely on results but instead placed more value on every subtle nuance in the process. I began actively learning new skills and constantly challenging my limits. I was no longer satisfied with the status quo but yearned to achieve my goals someday.

What moved me most was that I genuinely felt myself getting a little better every single day.

In the internet era, browsers have become an indispensable part of daily life. Browser extensions are software that adds functionality to browsers, providing users with a better online experience. In this article, I will introduce some commonly used browser extensions.

---

## uBlock Origin

uBlock Origin is a lightweight ad-blocking extension that automatically blocks ads, trackers, and malware on webpages. It performs excellently and consumes less memory compared to similar extensions.

## 1Password

1Password is a password management extension that helps users generate strong passwords, save passwords, and auto-fill forms. It is a stable password software extension that supports all platforms.

## Immersive Translate

Immersive Translate is a language learning extension that provides users with a more natural and fluent translation experience. It supports translation in multiple languages and allows translation while browsing webpages, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting. This extension helps users better read and learn foreign language materials.

- Subtitle translation for YouTube videos
- Webpage translation
- Supports translation services like DeepL and OpenAI

## Violentmonkey

Violentmonkey is a script management extension that allows users to implement custom features by writing scripts, such as auto-filling forms or skipping ads. This extension requires some programming skills, but once mastered, it can bring great convenience to users.

## FigmaCN

FigmaCN is a design extension that translates the Figma interface into Chinese, making it more convenient for Chinese users to design with Figma. This extension improves design efficiency and reduces the impact of language barriers.

## Minimal Theme for Twitter

Recently, I've been spending more time scrolling through Twitter. This is a modern-style extension that simplifies the Twitter interface.

## Notion Web Clipper

An official tool for temporarily saving articles you want to read.

## ~~Simplified Reading~~

~~Simplified Reading is a reading experience optimization extension that provides users with a clearer and more concise article reading page. It removes distracting elements like ads and sidebars from webpages and optimizes article layout for the best reading experience. This extension enhances the reading experience and reduces visual fatigue.~~

> I placed too much emphasis on reading mode; what I actually needed was a way to temporarily save content for reading. Simplified Reading's configuration and synchronization were too complex.

## ~~Relingo~~

~~Relingo is a language learning extension that provides webpage translation functionality. It supports translation in multiple languages and can automatically detect and translate languages. This extension helps users better understand and learn foreign language materials.~~

> Immersive Translate has updated its YouTube translation feature, so I've replaced Relingo's built-in video and selected text translation with it.

## Conclusion

Browser extensions bring many convenient and practical features to users, enabling them to use online resources more efficiently. The extensions introduced above are all highly practical, and users are advised to choose the ones that best suit their needs.

Changelog:

- 2023-10-23: Removed Relingo and Simplified Reading; added Notion Web Clipper and Minimal Theme for Twitter.

Yesterday, while watching the show "Infinity and Beyond - Greater Bay Area," I saw Brother Jordan Chan perform this song, and it still moved me deeply. This song is one of the tracks I have on repeat in my playlist and is also one of the few sweet songs in his repertoire. The lyrics were written by Wyman, and the music was composed by Chan Kwong Wing. The entire song is full of emotional power, and every time I listen to it, I can't help but get teary-eyed.

The moment that made me fall in love with this song was the performance version from the 2015 "Young and Dangerous: Friendship Over Time Concert." During the performance, his sweet interaction with his wife, Ding Ding, created a classic and memorable scene in Cantonese music.

**Lyrics:**

Even if everything around us makes no sense
I will always be connected with you
You won't let go of me, I won't let go of you
I want to make sure I hold the same arm every day

I dare not die early, I must stay to accompany you
I've experienced enough separations, and they're not very beautiful
How could I ever leave you behind

Years flow like water, washing away several lovers and confidants
Looking up, the spotlight of fate shines down on me and you
Could it be that someone leaves just to show how limited good times are
Teaching me to fear death and cling to life for your sake

Even if everything around us makes no sense
I will always be connected with you
You won't let go of me, I won't let go of you
I want to make sure I hold the same arm every day

I dare not die early, I must stay to accompany you
I've experienced enough separations, and they're not very beautiful
Having witnessed storms and turbulence
How could I ever bear to let you go

Proving to love both the lover and oneself
Why must it be so tragically grand to be reasonable

Even if everything around us makes no sense
I will always be connected with you
You won't let go of me, I won't let go of you
I want to make sure I hold the same arm every day

I dare not die early, I must stay to accompany you
I've experienced enough separations, and they're not very beautiful
Having witnessed storms and turbulence
How could I ever bear to let you go

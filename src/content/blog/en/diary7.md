Recently, due to the pandemic, several keys on my desktop keyboard at home broke, often interrupting my typing. With the new keyboard unable to be delivered, I suddenly remembered a program I had watched where the interviewee used voice input to write.

It occurred to me that I had a microphone gifted by my girlfriend at home. So, I dug out the long-unused microphone, downloaded an input method, and set up a simple voice input environment. After two days of use, I’ve gained some insights.

Turning off the input method’s automatic symbol completion and using Cantonese for drafting allows for a more relaxed thought process. When polishing the draft, I use Mandarin to paraphrase the Cantonese content, which helps identify unnoticed wording issues.

My writing mindset has also changed. Previously, I tended to expand on each point individually, resulting in fragmented content that required extensive revision during final polishing. With voice input, I now roughly follow my train of thought, dictating the general content before refining the wording of each sentence. Efficiency has greatly improved!

The keyboard input habits formed during the PC era made me subconsciously overlook the convenience of voice input. This experience with voice input has given me a new perspective, and I plan to use it more frequently for drafting in future writing.

This article was written using voice input. Drafting and polishing took about 30 minutes—highly efficient!

PS: In 2023, this article was revised using voice input + AI polishing, resulting in an even better overall experience than before. I hope the tools continue to improve.

## Lyrics:

---

I'll be fine  
The flowers still smell sweet  
Time keeps moving on  
The memories are truly beautiful  
I am thinking of you  
Always thinking of you  
You have become a secret  
Deep in my heart  

Don't say you love me, you miss me  
If that's not truly in your heart  
If you're just reluctantly humoring me  
I'll feel so hurt if I find out  

I want you to walk away silently, don't look back  
I'll clearly understand what you want  
No need to comfort me reluctantly  
With strange reasons  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

Don't say you love me, you miss me  
If that's not truly in your heart  
If you're just reluctantly humoring me  
I'll feel so hurt if I find out  

I want you to walk away silently, don't look back  
I'll clearly understand what you want  
No need to comfort me reluctantly  
With strange reasons  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

I'll be fine  
The flowers still smell sweet  
Time keeps moving on  
The memories are truly beautiful  
I am thinking of you  
Always thinking of you  
You have become a secret  
Deep in my heart  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

**Even now, I still deeply, deeply love you**  
**Whether it's love or friendship**  
**That is the happiness in my heart**  
**I know it's bittersweet**  

I'll send you blessings from afar  
I know it's bittersweet

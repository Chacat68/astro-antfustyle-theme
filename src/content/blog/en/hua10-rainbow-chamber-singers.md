> Chinese Music Collection: Documenting the Chinese music that accompanied my growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

## Introduction

In the works of Rainbow Chamber Singers, there is no lofty preaching, only equal dialogue and gentle companionship. They understand the exhaustion of overtime workers, the anxiety of young people, and every ordinary person struggling through life.

They sing about "looking for keys," "the fatigue of overtime," and "being pressured about marriage during the New Year"—these utterly ordinary fragments of life.

Life is hard, but Rainbow Chamber Singers use humor to tell us: even when it's hard, we can face it with a smile. Their "fun" is not cheap comedy but intelligent humor—within the laughter lies insight into life; within the absurdity lies an understanding of human nature.

## Songs That Chronicle Life

### 《A Letter from Grandpa》

"My grandpa was a very interesting person; he didn't allow me to call him 'grandpa'." The opening of this song carries warm and slightly playful memories. *A Letter from Grandpa* is one of Rainbow Chamber Singers' most moving recent works, using music to tell a story about family, growth, and farewell.

In the lyrics, Grandpa is not a traditional elder but more like an interesting friend. He taught "me" to be **optimistic, interesting, and kind**—these three words precisely capture the spiritual core that Rainbow Chamber Singers have always embodied. In the gentle chorus, we see the passing down of life and how love transcends time and space to continue warming our lives.

This song doesn't resort to deliberate sentimentality, yet its calm narration brings tears to the eyes. Because in everyone's heart, there is such an important person whose teachings and companionship become the most precious gifts in our lives.

**This sincerity stems from their most genuine expression of life and emotion.**

### 《Saying Goodbye Is a Difficult Thing》

"Since we can't forget, why not just pretend?" This line captures the feelings of so many facing farewell. *Saying Goodbye Is a Difficult Thing* is a song Rainbow Chamber Singers dedicated to all who have experienced parting—leaving hometowns, saying goodbye to loved ones, and bidding farewell to times that can never return.

The preciousness of this song lies in its premiere at the Wuhan Qintai Concert Hall in November 2021, which remains its only live performance. Jin Chengzhi uses the word "pretend" with a double meaning: the helplessness of "pretending to forget" and the tenderness of "keeping the longing in one's heart." On the longest night in the Northern Hemisphere, this song accompanied every soul unable to let go of their memories.

The **kindness** of Rainbow Chamber Singers is reflected in their understanding that everyone carries unspeakable longing in their hearts. They use music to tell us: if you can't forget, there's no need to force yourself; it's better to keep it safely tucked away.

### 《The Drunkard's Toast》

"Let's raise our glasses and toast to all those who strive to live." This is the most touching moment in *The Drunkard's Toast*. This song was born at the celebration banquet after the premiere of the *Starlight Hotel* suite. It lacks the refinement of a concert or the stage effects of a variety show, but it carries the most authentic "drunkenness" and "wine."

In this version, the members of Rainbow Chamber Singers sit together, raising their glasses, singing with slightly tipsy voices to pay tribute to life. This song is not just a toast but a tribute to every ordinary person who struggles and strives forward in life. Whether you're an office worker, an entrepreneur, or a young person chasing dreams, this song is sung for you.

Rainbow Chamber Singers' **humor** and **sincerity** achieve perfect balance in this song—there is the boldness of raising glasses together and the tenderness of mutual understanding.

## Fun & Viral Songs

### 《Spring Festival Survival Guide》

"Spring Festival Survival Guide" is a song full of humor and wisdom, created specifically for young people feeling immense pressure during the Spring Festival. The lyrics humorously depict various awkward scenarios common during the holiday, such as being pressured by relatives about marriage or being asked about work, while also offering some "survival" tips. This song not only makes people laugh out loud but also helps them find resonance and comfort in the laughter.

### 《Zhang Shichao, Where on Earth Did You Put My House Keys?》 (Suona Version)

This is a super classic from Rainbow Chamber Singers, revived in a brand-new suona version at the New Year's Eve concert on December 31, 2020! The song that made Rainbow Chamber Singers "famous overnight" now incorporates the suona, a traditional Chinese instrument, making the whole song even more festive and lively—almost sending Mr. Zhang off for good!

### 《What You Want Will Come True》

"May all you gain be what you desire, shake off sorrow and worry, may everything go smoothly!" This song, *What You Want Will Come True*, is Rainbow Chamber Singers' New Year blessing to everyone. This performance, dubbed the "These People Are So Weird Version," is filled with the group's signature humor and warmth.

The lyrics are simple and direct, yet brimming with longing and wishes for a better life. In a melody that is slightly quirky yet highly infectious, the members use exaggerated expressions and movements to portray the simple wish of "what you want will come true" in a way that is both hilarious and sincere. This song is like a gentle incantation, offering strength and hope to all weary souls at the start of the New Year.

Rainbow Chamber Singers use this song to tell us: life is hard, but we must still hold onto hope for beauty; what we want may not come true immediately, but at least we can sing it out loud!

## Albums

### 《Zeya Collection》

*Zeya Collection* is one of Rainbow Chamber Singers' most artistic works, created by Jin Chengzhi during a vacation in Zeya Mountain, Wenzhou, in 2015. This a cappella choral collection, set against the backdrop of Zhejiang's landscapes and villages, incorporates elements of Wenzhou folk culture. It includes seven chapters such as *Bamboo Forest*, *Evening Glow*, and *Stream*, depicting natural imagery and pastoral life through the changing seasons.

The work employs multi-voice vocal arrangements, blending dialect vocabulary and casual language to present a pastoral singing style. Centered around scenes like stone bridges, rice fields, and fishing villages, it constructs a flowing sense of space through imagery such as "coast at dusk" and "son-in-law returning with sheep at night," creating a tranquil and distant rural landscape. *Zeya Collection* shows us that Rainbow Chamber Singers can not only create "viral songs" but also produce serious music with depth and substance.

### 《Starlight Hotel》

Released in 2021, *Starlight Hotel* is Rainbow Chamber Singers' sixth choral suite and a bold artistic innovation. This work consists of 13 songs, from *The Journey* to *Starlight*, constructing a complete cosmic travel story.

In this "musical novel," there is the fantastical *Burning Star! Fat Cat Man*, the lively and playful *Waltz of the Wandering Asteroid*, the deeply reflective *Black Hole and Hot Bath*, and, of course, the familiar *The Drunkard's Toast*. The album marks the first attempt to incorporate rich instrumentation, vocal narration, and sampling, blending orchestral music with subtle electronic elements, showcasing the infinite possibilities of Rainbow Chamber Singers' musical exploration.

### 《White Horse Village Travelogue》 and 《Sunset Collection》

*White Horse Village Travelogue* (2018) was selected for the Tencent Music Wave Chart's "100 Best Chinese Albums 2011–2020." This work continues Rainbow Chamber Singers' deep affection for China's rural homeland. The 2019 *Sunset Collection* includes seven songs and was nominated for several major music awards, further establishing Rainbow Chamber Singers' position in the Chinese music scene.

These albums showcase the multifaceted nature of Rainbow Chamber Singers: they inherit traditional culture while exploring modern music; they pursue serious artistic goals while tenderly documenting life.

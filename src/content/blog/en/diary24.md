The recent continuous rainy days, interspersed with a few typhoons, have kept me stuck at home, feeling a bit restless. Coincidentally, the weekend brought clear skies. I went downstairs, sat on a bench, and enjoyed the warm afternoon sun.

A sunny day can effectively heal low spirits. Feeling the sun on your back, its warm temperature can lift your mood.

It seems like the happiness we long for—always appearing scarce, yet permeating our daily lives. Pause your steps, and the present sunlight is enough to make one feel happy.

Recently, I watched a 2016 film called *Hidden Figures*. In specific circumstances, perhaps we can make choices and strive to achieve what we want. Time is longer than we imagine, and for individuals, it holds great significance.

One scene left a deep impression on me. When one of the female protagonists was competing for a spot in night school, she chose to share the judge's growth story. He achieved many "firsts," meaning no one had done it before him, which is why it could be called a first. Allowing the female protagonist to attend night school was also a "first."

This is just like scarce sunny days!

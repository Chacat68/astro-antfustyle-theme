## Lyrics:

I don't care to ask about my kiss in your heart  
Weary, my debt replaces the one you love  
At this moment, my heart falls like scattered petals  
Suddenly, my vision loses all its color  

I know you're also not good at expressing yourself  
Imagining the excuses woven by your love, growing slack  
Sweet scenes also fall like scattered petals  
From then on, my life turns to dust  

Lonely people always grow accustomed to the stability of loneliness  
At least our straight lines once intersected  
Like standing on a scorching sunlit bridge  
Tears rush down, falling on my face  

I know you're also not good at expressing yourself  
Imagining the excuses woven by your love, growing slack  
Sweet scenes also fall like scattered petals  
From then on, my life turns to dust  

Lonely people always grow accustomed to the stability of loneliness  
At least our straight lines once intersected  
Like standing on a scorching sunlit bridge  
Tears rush down, falling on my face  

La la la la, la la la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la la la

Recently, I've been busy working overtime to meet deadlines and haven't been able to spend quality time with the people around me. My girlfriend and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary, and this year we kept it casual as usual. She took me to a new place, where we discovered an incredibly delicious restaurant. We drank, ate skewers, and all the worries and fatigue seemed to fade away with the laughter.

Lately, I've been extremely busy, but I've been trying to carve out time to be with family and friends and adjust my life rhythm. This includes taking care of my physical well-being, and my feelings of anxiety and irritability have lessened quite a bit.

Yesterday, I visited the Pudong Art Museum, which I really like. From the outside, it's a very simple building! But once inside, I was really drawn to the texture of the architecture and the flow of movement.

The building makes extensive use of windows, creating many viewing spaces. Observing from different angles, each perspective offers its own unique pleasure.

Through a window, I captured the afternoon sunlight casting dappled spots on the pure white walls, echoing the theme on a poster. This is my favorite photo from recent times.

A friend invited me to a birthday party. We happily chatted, cooked together, caught up on each other's recent lives, and discussed industry trends. It felt really nice to reunite with old friends.

While waiting for a ride, I saw BMW's Halloween market. The people participating in the market activities had joyful smiles on their faces, which quickly infected me and made me genuinely happy from the heart.

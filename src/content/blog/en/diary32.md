## Preface

Time flies like a fleeting white horse, and in the blink of an eye, a month has passed. I was fully immersed in company projects during this period and finally wrapped them up successfully before the holiday. After shedding the heavy burden of work, I felt much more relaxed, and even my sleep became exceptionally sound.

At the beginning of the holiday, I first caught up on sleep and then dedicated myself to creating personal projects. Continuously building demos to familiarize myself with the engine is the most effective way to learn.

## Open-Source Video Website

On the 31st, I stumbled upon a well-designed open-source video aggregation platform, which immediately piqued my interest. After forking the project on GitHub, I used Vercel's one-click deployment feature to go from zero to a live site in just 30 minutes—incredibly convenient.

The most delightful aspect of this platform is its powerful aggregation capability, seamlessly integrating content from multiple video websites. Now, with just one page, I can easily search for the video resources I need, significantly improving information retrieval efficiency.

## ModelScope Community

Recently, while exploring the MCP protocol, I learned about Alibaba's ModelScope community through Cherry Studio. As part of the Alibaba Cloud ecosystem, ModelScope provides a convenient MCP Plaza, aggregating a wealth of high-quality model computing platform resources. It supports direct connection and usage via the web interface, offering a quite smooth operational experience.

The core advantage of ModelScope lies in its extremely simple deployment process. Users can set up a complete MCP environment in just a few simple steps, greatly lowering the technical barrier to entry.

The current MCP ecosystem is still in its early stages of development, facing issues such as relatively low query efficiency and uneven application quality. However, its technical potential should not be underestimated. For example, by integrating multiple MCP sources like Amap and web data for joint queries, the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the results are already noticeably superior to traditional web searches.

From a return-on-investment perspective, the time saved by adopting MCP technology has already fully offset the time investment required to overcome the initial learning curve.

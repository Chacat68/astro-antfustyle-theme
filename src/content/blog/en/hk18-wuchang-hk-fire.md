> Hong Kong Music Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in our hearts, sharing stories of Hong Kong music, whether popular or niche.

In December 2025, a heartbreaking fire occurred in Hong Kong, shocking the world.

Upon learning this news, "Not the Lyric God" and Sister Xin decided to send their heartfelt wishes to our Hong Kong compatriots through music. As the creators said: "Such immense pain is incredibly difficult to soothe. But perhaps we can offer a song, a gesture of care, and an embrace."

A song titled "Impermanence" speaks of the ever-changing world and the impermanence of life. In the face of disaster, humanity seems so small, yet love and warmth can transcend everything. This song is not merely a cover; it is a profound expression of care and blessing from mainland compatriots to Hong Kong.

## Creation Information

Lyrics: Ruoxin / Sanbenmu
Composer: Cui Wenhao

Don't cry too much
Why are your eyes filled with tears and sorrow
Don't dwell on the outcome
The days we shared were truly good

A pile of unread messages
Shows you haven't let go of me
Like the unchanged decor at home
Creating the illusion I never left

Can you be braver tomorrow
I hope you won't be sad anymore
Still grateful for you and me
Sharing our rights and wrongs

Many encounters await you in the days to come
The mundane world has laid it bare
I hope you untie the knot in your heart
And stop clinging to me

Can you be braver tomorrow
I hope you won't be sad anymore
Please understand and accept
This lesson fate has given us

I'd rather tears vanish into the Milky Way
Look up and don't see me anymore
Just store the memories in your heart
Instead of thinking of me

No need to think of me too much

Don't cry too much
After bowing, step back and make way
Please meet someone
Who brings you a fortunate story

A pile of unread messages
Shows you haven't let go of me
Like the unchanged decor at home
Creating the illusion I never left

Can you be braver tomorrow
I hope you won't be sad anymore
Still grateful for you and me
Sharing our rights and wrongs

Many encounters await you in the days to come
The mundane world has laid it bare
I hope you untie the knot in your heart
And stop clinging to me

Can you be braver tomorrow
Let someone else take my place
To accompany you like I did
Loving and caring for you would be good too

I'd rather tears vanish into the Milky Way
Look up and don't see me anymore
Just let go of the memories in your heart
And stop thinking of me

May tomorrow be better

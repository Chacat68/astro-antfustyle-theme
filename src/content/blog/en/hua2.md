## Lyrics:

---

This time I stubbornly face it, indulging willfully
I don't care if it's wrong or right
This is falling deep, I disregard everything
This is obsession, and I'm obsessed without regret

Don't tell me I should give up, I should open my eyes
I use my heart to see, to feel
You are not me, how could you understand?
This is obsession, just let me be obsessed without regret

I'm not as perfect as you imagine
I admit sometimes I can't distinguish truth from falsehood
It's not that I'm unwilling to escape the maze
It's just that this time, this time it's about myself, not anyone else

Whose heart should I use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if it's painful, these tears are also my sorrow

Whose heart can I still use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if I'm weary, this exhaustion
Can only lead to obsession, without regret

Don't tell me I should give up, I should open my eyes
I use my heart to see, to feel
You are not me, how could you understand?
This is obsession, just let me be obsessed without regret

I'm not as perfect as you imagine
I admit sometimes I can't distinguish truth from falsehood
It's not that I'm unwilling to escape the maze
It's just that this time, this time it's about myself, not anyone else

Whose heart should I use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if it's painful, these tears are also my sorrow

Whose heart can I still use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if I'm weary, this exhaustion
Can only lead to obsession, without regret

Whose heart should I use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if it's painful, these tears are also my sorrow

Whose heart can I still use to understand?
To truly and genuinely feel my surroundings
Even if I'm weary, this exhaustion
Can only lead to obsession, without regret

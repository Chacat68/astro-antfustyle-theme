> Chinese Pop Collection: Documenting the Chinese pop music that accompanies our growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

Upon first hearing "Pushing Open the World's Door," one is drawn in by its breeze-like melody and unhurried narration: there's no noisy layering, yet strength is hidden within its gentleness. The lyrics feel like a conversation with one's younger self, reminding us that even in a present where "the world's pace is too fast," we must still preserve our own warmth and rhythm (as mentioned in the program description on the Bilibili submission page: "The world's pace is too fast, leaving behind many beautiful things").

This official MV adopts a documentary-style approach. The camera moves through Taipei's live houses and the creative spaces of various artists, authentically capturing the light of passion and perseverance. Faith Yang, in her role as a musician, shares the frame with 13 artists from different fields. At the intersection of their work and reality, they present the sincere texture of "pushing open a door with earnestness held in one's palm" (MV directed by Chen Hongyi; the song is included in the 2016 album *Centrifugal Force*).

During graduation season, "pushing open the world's door" feels more like a blessing that needs no added encouragement: there's no need to rush to prove oneself. First, hold tight to your curiosity and goodwill towards the world, then step out at your own pace. As many viewers have felt—every "first time" deserves to be treated gently. This is why the song was also chosen as the ending theme for the documentaries *The Firsts in Life* and *The Seconds in Life*, lending a more substantial warmth to the concept of growth.

## Lyrics

Pushing open the world's door
You are the one standing outside, afraid of being late
Holding a heart of earnestness that doesn't know how to calculate
Having kissed your eyes, it's a fearless youth

Pushing open the world's door
You are the one standing outside, afraid of being late
Holding a heart of earnestness that doesn't know how to calculate
Having kissed your eyes, it's a fearless youth

The mud on the left hand, the mud on the right hand
The flowery clothes of a confidant
The world should have been the way you woke up
The sadness in the left eye, the stubbornness in the right eye, they look the same
So you are the source of my self-assured courage

Pushing open the world's door
You are the loneliest person standing outside
Holding a heart of earnestness that doesn't know how to calculate
When passing by you, how cruel time is

The mud on the left hand, the mud on the right hand
The flowery clothes of a confidant
The world should have been your honest appearance
The sadness in the left eye, the stubbornness in the right eye, they look the same
So you are the place where I got lost

The mud on the left hand, the mud on the right hand
The flowery clothes of a confidant
The world should have been your honest appearance
The recklessness of youth, the wounds of old age, are all waiting to be forgiven by her
So you are my longing for atonement

The recklessness of youth, the wounds of old age, are all waiting to be forgiven by her
So you are the place I return to

Pushing open the world's door
The affection left for you, don't leave too quickly

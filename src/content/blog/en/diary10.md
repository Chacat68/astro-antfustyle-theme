Recently, the renovation of our family home was completed. My father wanted to return for the "housewarming" ceremony, so he bought a last-minute ticket and embarked on the journey home.

# Memories of the New Home

## "Housewarming" Customs

The Guangdong region has some unique housewarming customs. Here are a few common ones:

1.  **Opening with Red:** On the day of the housewarming, red paper or red decorations are pasted or hung at the entrance of the house, symbolizing joy and auspiciousness.
2.  **Bed Placement:** After moving into the new home, the bed is placed first. An auspicious day, often a favorable date on the lunar calendar, is usually chosen for this to seek peace and good fortune.
3.  **Lighting Lamps for Blessings:** On the evening of the housewarming, lanterns and candles are lit inside the house to pray for the family's happiness and tranquility.
4.  **Family Feast:** After moving in, family and friends gather for a celebratory feast. A lavish spread of dishes is typically prepared to signify joy and reunion.
5.  **Offering Prayers:** After the move, a Taoist priest or an elder in the family may be invited to conduct a prayer ceremony, asking for divine blessings for the family's safety, health, and prosperity.

These customs reflect the importance and celebration attached to moving into a new home in the Guangdong region, with hopes that the new residence will bring good luck, happiness, and prosperity.

At the housewarming banquet, I saw many people I hadn't met in years—some relatives, some elders. With each meeting, fragments of memory were pieced together, forming new recollections. It made me feel that in this world, there are still so many people who remember you.

## Life at Home

I experienced the pace of life in my hometown again after a long time and enjoyed the wonderfully fragrant congee made at home.

## Flight Delay on the Return Journey

On the way back, the flight couldn't take off due to weather conditions at the destination airport. This gave me time to observe my hometown's airport. I walked through the entire terminal, studying its layout thoroughly. I went to the lounge for dinner, heard the boarding announcement, and happily rushed to the gate, only to find out the time had been pushed back again, and some supplies were distributed.

## Taking Off in a Thunderstorm

By evening, the weather at the destination had finally improved enough for takeoff. Rain began to fall at the departure airport. At first, I thought it was just a light drizzle, but once the plane was in the air, I realized it was far from that.

Shortly after takeoff, the pilot made a sharp, steep turn. I started to feel something was off. Looking out the window, I saw a thunderstorm cell to the left of the plane, and the pilot was clearly trying to navigate around it.

After experiencing several bouts of turbulence and weightlessness, I took out my phone to record a video of the thunderstorm, documenting this unusual experience.

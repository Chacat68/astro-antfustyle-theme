## Lyrics

History, long river, with you
Separated, intersecting, across time
You sowed with your own hands
That flower blooms, greeting the wind
Like fire, burning out, righteous courage
Sheltering sweet dreams with your body
Never met, yet forever in my heart

Honored today, in ten thousand homes, to see
Joyful, smiling faces of the world
Prosperity and tomorrow, being built
On this day, can your wish come true?
Witnessing with the times, the transformation of mountains and rivers
Holding fast to the belief of the pioneers
May you, beyond this mortal realm, also see
This prosperous era's small reunion

Silent, wordless, pain
Starlit, brilliant, night sky
Once, didn't quite understand
Strong grass must endure fierce winds
Common, ordinary, the masses
Born into the flow of time
As days pass, I too will embrace you

Honored today, in ten thousand homes, to see
Joyful, smiling faces of the world
Prosperity and tomorrow, being built
On this day, can your wish come true?
Witnessing with the times, the transformation of mountains and rivers
The road ahead, stepping as you chose
Grand wishes, finally can be seen
This prosperous era's small reunion

Blood so hot
Makes me look up
Realizing the hopes you held in your heart
This prosperous era
Sacrifices not in vain
The blazing red sun shines upon the East

Honored today, in ten thousand homes, to see
Joyful, smiling faces of the world
Prosperity, tomorrow, being built
On this day, can your wish come true?
Once promised, a glorious tomorrow could be seen
Continuing your magnificent verse
Stars in the sky, you in my heart
Forever by my side

Grateful for yesterday's bitterness and astringency
Exchanged for today's sweetness

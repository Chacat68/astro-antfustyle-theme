The overall feeling of this year: freedom, calm, and upheaval. Myself, family, and the surrounding society are all undergoing intense changes.

I actively distanced myself from the internet, creating time and space for inward observation. This led to many questions, so I turned to books and action to seek answers. In my free time, I went out for walks, listening to podcasts along the way, letting my thoughts drift with the hosts' voices.

I dismantled many concepts and let go of numerous desires. Possibilities diminished, but that wasn't a bad thing—perhaps they never truly belonged to me. I kept doing things and making adjustments, wandering across the plains of life. I left some traces and found some directions. I'll continue next year.

In the process of constant exploration and reflection, certain words always lingered in my mind. Now, I record them immediately. After organizing and editing, I always end up with some text. It might not be perfect, but it's enough. What matters is that these words resonate with my life; they belong to me.

Following advice from *纵横四海*, I wrote my *Life White Paper*, continuously recording my life's journey from my earliest memories in this book. Looking back at old writings and photos gave me a sense of time flowing by, filling me with emotion. The bittersweet and joyful moments from the journey all surfaced—it felt wonderful!

It seems I've come to understand myself better? Maybe it's an illusion, but it doesn't matter. We always need to keep colliding with ourselves, others, and life's trivialities to discern what to embrace and what to let go. What remains eventually becomes us.

This year, through various opportunities, I met old and new friends. Perhaps because of the distance we'd maintained, I cherished our time together even more. After thorough conversations, our hearts drew closer. Reuniting with old friends is a blessing.

I'm still constantly exploring AI technology. It seems to have become my new pursuit, helping me solve many mundane tasks, saving energy, and allowing me to refocus on creating better content. I frequently converse with it, seeking direction, polishing content, and ultimately leaving behind something of value.

As this year ends, many questions have been resolved, and the fog on the path has cleared. Clear and affirmed goals naturally emerge. May 2025 bring even greater conviction. Let's keep working hard.

Happy New Year! Thanks for reading! 🚶‍♀️

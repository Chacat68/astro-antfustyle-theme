> Lately, I've found a new rhythm to life between cycling and hiking, and in reuniting with old friends, I've rediscovered those warm moments buried by busyness.

## Reuniting with an Old Friend

An old friend flew in from Shanghai; we hadn't seen each other for two years. I deliberately cleared my entire evening to spend with him, going to eat at that dai pai dong in the old street—my favorite old haunt.

We sat around the table, eating and chatting just like old times. Time slipped away amidst laughter, and those familiar feelings came rushing back. He talked about life in Shanghai, and I shared about my recent days in Guangzhou. Once we started talking, it felt like the two-year gap just melted away.

## Days of Cycling

I recently got a bicycle, and from the initial unfamiliarity, I've now grown to love it. Cycling through the city every day, riding against the wind, has made me feel much more at ease.

Riding home at noon saves time and gets the body moving. The daily commute back and forth has made me feel the vitality in my body, and the fatigue accumulated from work slowly dissipates with each pedal stroke. The pace of life has also slowed down.

## Weekends in the Mountains

On weekends, I like to pack my bag and head to the nearby mountains. The early autumn forest is layered and dense, and the sound of stepping on fallen leaves rustles underfoot, occasionally punctuated by bird calls. The higher I climb, the more expansive the view becomes, with the city behind me faintly visible through the mist and clouds.

Sitting at the mountaintop, feeling the breeze, munching on some dry rations, and gazing at the rolling hills—this simple joy feels the most genuine. Hiking with an old friend, encouraging each other along the way, we made a pact to take good care of our health.

## Ordinary Days

Life lately has been just like this—no major events, but in these everyday moments, I've found a rare sense of balance. Spending time with an old friend taught me to cherish; cycling helped me discover small joys; the mountains helped me find inner peace.

Life should be like this, I think—no need to chase after anything deliberately, just feel the present moment with heart. The scenery seen while cycling, the fresh air breathed in the mountains, the laughter shared with an old friend—these seemingly ordinary moments, strung together, are life itself.

I'm slowly realizing that happiness is actually in these ordinary days.

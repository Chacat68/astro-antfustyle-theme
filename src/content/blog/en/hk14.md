## Preface

In the history of Chinese music concerts, some performances become the collective memory of a generation. Eason Chan's DUO concert held at the Hong Kong Coliseum in 2010 is undoubtedly such a classic. This concert not only broke Eason Chan's personal record at the Coliseum with eighteen consecutive shows but also, with its unique "DUO (Dual)" theme, offered audiences an unprecedented experience in song selection and stage presentation.

Time flies, and over a decade has passed since this concert, yet its charm remains undiminished. Whenever the melodies play, it feels as if we are transported back to that stage with its turning gears, back to the moment Eason Chan appeared with his half-black, half-white look.

## Concert Highlights

### The Unique Design of the Dual Theme

"DUO" means dual-sided, and this concert's theme revolves precisely around this concept. Eason Chan made his entrance with a half-black, half-white look, and the stage backdrop was designed in the shape of gears, symbolizing the flow of time. The entire stage design, reminiscent of the melting clocks in Dalí's *The Persistence of Memory*, consistently embodied the theme of time.

Under this theme, Eason Chan not only performed his own classic songs but also covered numerous hits by other artists. Of the nearly 40 songs, almost one-third were works by other singers, such as Roman Tam's "A Good Song for You," Faye Wong's "Promise," and Leslie Cheung's "Lonely Night." This cross-boundary performance perfectly embodied the "DUO" theme.

### The Touching Tribute to Leslie Cheung

One of the most moving moments of the concert was Eason Chan's tribute to the late singer Leslie Cheung. After performing "Promise," he turned to the audience and said:

"Thank you. There's a friend... I don't know if you all feel the same, but I've missed him for seven years. A few days ago was the anniversary of his passing. During his lifetime, he once said something very caring to me, but I never had the chance to say anything back to him, to speak to him face-to-face. This made me realize that when you have the chance to say something, say it quickly. Don't hold back your words, don't overthink it. But it's okay, I know he can hear us now. Gor Gor (哥哥, elder brother, a term of endearment for Leslie), tonight, this next song represents what's in my heart for you. Thank you."

He then looked up at a 45-degree angle and performed Leslie Cheung's "Lonely Night." In that moment, the entire audience was deeply moved.

### The High-Energy Performance of "Exaggerated"

The rendition of "Exaggerated" in this concert is considered a classic among classics. Although Eason Chan's voice was affected by a cold, the hoarseness added a touch of沧桑 (vicissitudes) and power to the song. With the配合 (coordination) of stage effects, his roar seemed to穿透 (pierce through) time and space, striking directly at everyone's heart.

It's worth noting that the melody of "Exaggerated," titled "Depression," was originally composed by Hong Kong composer C.Y. Kong after learning of Leslie Cheung's passing, expressing grief over the loss of his friend. Eason Chan once wanted to write the lyrics himself to express his思念 (longing/missing) for Gor Gor. This was the only time he ever wanted to personally write lyrics for a song, a task ultimately given to Wyman Wong.

## Selected Tracks

The song selection for this concert was extremely rich, featuring both Eason Chan's own classics and tributes to other artists. Here are some selected tracks:

1.  **"Today I Wait for Myself"** - Eason Chan opened with this song, as if telling the audience, "Today, let me bring you an unforgettable performance."
2.  **"A Good Song for You"** (Original singer: Roman Tam) - This cover showed Eason Chan's respect for his前辈 (seniors/elders in the field).
3.  **"Falling Flowers, Flowing Water"** - A song full of禅意 (Zen-like meaning). Eason Chan sat at the corner of the gear-shaped stage,娓娓道来 (recounting gently).
4.  **"Wedding Invitation Street"** - Accompanied by guitarist Ellen's gentle strumming, Eason Chan's performance was格外动人 (particularly moving). (Ellen refers to the late musician Ellen Joyce Loo, who passed away in 2018 due to bipolar disorder.)
5.  **"Promise"** (Original singer: Faye Wong) - Many consider Eason Chan's rendition to have surpassed the original, with extremely到位 (precise/spot-on) emotional expression.
6.  **"Lonely Night"** (Original singer: Leslie Cheung) - A深情 (deeply emotional) tribute to Leslie Cheung.
7.  **"Exaggerated"** - One of the concert's climaxes, Eason Chan's roar震撼 (shook) the entire venue.
8.  **"Peerless Beauty"** - Eason Chan played two roles,模仿 (imitating) both Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung, showcasing his multifaceted talent.

## The Concert's Impact

This concert was not only a significant milestone in Eason Chan's personal artistic career but also had a profound impact on the entire Chinese music scene. It is hailed as one of the unsurpassed classic concerts in Chinese music history, still watched and listened to repeatedly by countless fans today.

Many moments from the concert, such as the performance of "Exaggerated" and the tribute to Leslie Cheung, have become classics among classics, celebrated by countless people. Eason Chan's performance on stage further solidified his status as a top-tier singer in the Chinese music scene.

More importantly, this concert made many people fall in love with Eason Chan and with Cantonese songs. As the video uploader mentioned, he偶然 (accidentally) saw this concert during his university years. Afterwards, not only did he become a fan of Eason Chan, but he also got his dorm mates to like Eason Chan. This kind of influence is precisely the charm of good music and great concerts.

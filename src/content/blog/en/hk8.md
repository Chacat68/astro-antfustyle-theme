> Cantopop Collection: Counting down those eras of Cantonese songs intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in the heart, sharing popular or niche stories of Hong Kong music.

## Preface

After experiencing many uncertainties in life, we often find the world is not as we wish. Plans get disrupted, dreams are shelved, and unmet expectations become commonplace. Everyone has faced such moments: when you push open a door full of anticipation, only to find the scenery behind it completely different from what you imagined. This sense of disparity, this feeling of powerlessness, can sometimes be suffocating and disorienting.

However, as Charmaine Fong sings in this song "If the World Turns Out Not as You Expected," perhaps the true meaning of life lies not in everything going as planned, but in how we face those moments that defy our expectations. When storms arrive, do we choose to escape, or do we meet the challenges with a humble heart? When the entire city is changing, do we go with the flow, or do we hold fast to our inner selves, never diminishing "you are you"?

This cover version by the Southern District Children's Choir, interpreting this philosophical song with pure children's voices, has a unique charm. The determination and hope conveyed through those clear voices seem to tell us: storms always have an end; you'll finally wait for what you dream of.

## Lyrics

Let me cut open this body, take out the shattered heart and reset it
Time will leisurely carry away joy, anger, and resentment
Learn to thank the wrong person

A bit of ignorance in youth
Growing up, just wanting to be carefree
Trying to forget yesterday's constant attempts
I know how sad you are

If the world turns out not as you expected
Still hold a humble heart to face the unsettled weather
Storms won't last forever; you'll finally wait for what you dream of
The whole city is changing, but it doesn't diminish you being you

That bit of selfishness in human nature
Lost the way but finally became wise
You and I are actually too similar
I know how sad you are

If the world turns out not as you expected
Still hold a humble heart to face the unsettled weather
Please remember
If love turns out not as you expected
Then you understand you can't be together, achieving this truth of heartbreak
Storms always have an end; you'll finally wait for what you dream of
Time is changing, but it doesn't diminish you being you
Live freely as your true self

When everything turns out not as you expected
Then you understand you mustn't lose heart; walk another few thousand kilometers along the road
Be the best you

If the world turns out not as you expected
Then you understand you mustn't give up; endure the fluctuating psychology of love
Storms won't last forever; you'll finally wait for what you dream of
The whole city is changing, but it doesn't diminish you being you
My heart holds you

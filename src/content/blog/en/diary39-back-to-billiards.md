> Work has been exceptionally intense lately, inevitably bringing a sense of monotony and pressure into daily life. While chatting with family on the phone near home one day, I noticed a pool hall. Recently, I've started playing pool again.

## Rediscovering the Joy of Pool

The pool hall isn't far from my home—just a ten-minute walk. The environment is quite nice, with soft lighting and good air circulation. Whenever I feel like playing, I can head downstairs and walk over in an instant.

Today, I had a late lunch. By dinnertime, I went to the pool hall early, hired an assistant coach, and played for over an hour. It felt wonderful. When I finished, the sky had already darkened, streetlights were on, and a slight chill in the air felt particularly refreshing.

I walked across the street to McDonald's, ordered a chicken leg meal with a sense of ceremony, and sat in my usual spot, rewarding myself for the week's hard work. After the meal, I strolled home slowly, feeling exceptionally relaxed and happy.

## The Mindset of Playing

Playing pool has now become a regular routine for me. Whenever I have free time during the week, I ride my bike to the hall, order a glass of water, and quietly practice for an hour or two.

Returning to pool has made me realize that life needs such adjustments. No matter how busy work gets, it's important to set aside time for things you enjoy. For those two hours in front of the table, I can completely clear my mind and focus solely on the green felt before me.

This state of focus, in turn, enhances the quality of life. The calm and concentration gained during practice extend into work and daily life. Every time I finish practicing, I feel refreshed and clear-headed, and my sleep quality has noticeably improved.

I want to know if you can sit with pain—mine or your own—without moving to hide it, or fade it, or fix it.

🀄 I want to know if you can truly coexist with pain—mine or your own—without masking it, forgetting it, or being overly preoccupied with it.

I want to know if you can be with joy—mine or your own—if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes, without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human.

🀄 I want to know if you can truly embrace joy—mine or your own—dancing freely and unrestrained, letting passion fill your body from fingertips to toes, forgetting caution, harsh reality, and the constraints of human limitations in that moment.

I want to know if you can live with failure—yours and mine—and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, "Yes."

🀄 I want to know if you can face failure calmly—yours or mine—and even in defeat, stand by the lake and shout to the silver full moon, "I can."

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

🀄 I don’t care who you know or why you are here. I only want to know, when the fire of life burns fiercely, if you dare to stand with me at the heart of the flames, without flinching.

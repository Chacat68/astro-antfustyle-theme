A top-down simulation management game. The art style resembles early Zelda games, being relatively simple and retro. The art assets used are somewhat average, without particularly distinctive features.

A top-down RPG game. The scene design aligns well with our project, and the detailed environmental design is quite eye-catching and distinctive.

The art style draws deep inspiration from *Jiangnan Hundred Scenes*. The game lets players act as a county magistrate during the Song Dynasty, responsible for city development and management. It achieves high completion in depicting historical figures and the core economic gameplay of simulation management. Building upon the foundation of *Jiangnan*, it adds systems like navigation, combat, and collection, significantly enhancing playability.

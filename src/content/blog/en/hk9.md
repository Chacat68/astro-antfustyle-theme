> Cantopop Collection: Recounting the eras of Cantopop intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in our hearts, and sharing stories of Cantopop, whether mainstream or niche.

## Preface

When Priscilla Chan's voice begins to sing, time seems to flow back to the glorious era of Cantopop. The two classics "Thousands of Songs" and "Song of the Sunset," sharing the same melody but with different lyrics, are like two sides of the same coin of life: the former is a heartfelt confession of treasuring beautiful moments at parting, while the latter is a personal soliloquy after experiencing the vicissitudes of life. On the stage of "Infinity and Beyond - Greater Bay Area," Priscilla Chan, with her signature clear and bright voice, reinterprets these two songs that carry the collective memories of countless people. This is not only a dialogue across time with Anita Mui but also a deep, affectionate look back at that golden era.

Through these two songs, we glimpse the most moving characteristic of Cantopop—using the most plain words to express the full flavor of life. The lyrics by Lam Chun-keung are like a time-carving knife. The eternal hope in "Even if thousands of songs come in days to come" and the epiphany about life in "The setting sun is boundless, yet its brilliance lasts but a moment" both burst forth with soul-stirring power within simple melodies. In this era of rapid change, these classic melodies can still evoke our most sincere emotional resonance, reminding us that no matter how the world changes, the life themes of parting, growth, and perseverance are always worth singing about and remembering.

## "Thousands of Songs" Lyrics

Slowly looking back, at the night that once belonged to us both
Still red is the radiant sun you gave my heart
If foolish tears flow, I hope for your understanding and forgiveness
Tomorrow morning I leave you, the road ahead may be lonely and long

In an instant, there's too much to say
But sadly, we're about to be far apart
I can only deeply fix this moment in my gaze

Even if thousands of songs come in days to come, drifting on my distant path
Even if thousands of evening stars in days to come shine brighter than tonight's moon
None can compare to the beauty of this night, nor could they make me appreciate it more
Ah-ha, because tonight you sing with me

Ha

At the moment of parting, I suddenly feel the beauty of sorrow
It turns out it's all you who makes my memories so long
In which year, which month, can we have another night like this?
In this lingering gaze, let our eyes speak our positions to each other

When someday raindrops lightly tap your window
When the wind disrupts your thoughts
Could you spare a moment to think of this old appearance?

Even if thousands of songs come in days to come, drifting on my distant path
Even if thousands of evening stars in days to come shine brighter than tonight's moon
None can compare to the beauty of this night, nor could they make me appreciate it more
Ah-ha, because tonight you sing with me

Ah, nothing can compare to the beauty of this night
Nor could it make me appreciate it more
Because tonight I can sing with you

Even if thousands of songs come in days to come, drifting on my distant path
Even if thousands of evening stars in days to come shine brighter than tonight's moon
None can compare to the beauty of this night, nor could they make me appreciate it more
Ah-ha, because tonight you sing with me

Even if thousands of songs come in days to come, drifting on my distant path
Even if thousands of evening stars in days to come shine brighter than tonight's moon
None can compare to the beauty of this night, nor can they wash away what I think tonight
Because I don't know on which day I'll sing with you again

## "Song of the Sunset" Lyrics

The setting sun is boundless, yet its brilliance lasts but a moment
As the clouds and glow gradually scatter, the faded radiance will not return
Slow-passing years, hard to endure the changes of this life
Like gathering and scattering clouds, entwining this weary face marked by time
On the long road, I suddenly feel time receding
Joy is always brief and does not return
Who sees through that my dream is a simple life?
I've encountered how many storms and upheavals
Weaving my interlaced dreams
I've encountered your sincere embrace
Accompanying me through hardship
Weary and disheartened from奔波
On the road, another bend of纷扰 and setbacks
One day I think of returning, but it's already late
The setting sun is boundless, yet its brilliance lasts but a moment
As the clouds and glow gradually scatter, the faded radiance will not return
Slow-passing years, hard to endure the changes of this life
Like gathering and scattering clouds, entwining this weary face marked by time
On the long road, I suddenly feel time receding
Joy is always brief and does not return
Who sees through that my dream is a simple life?
I've encountered how many storms and upheavals
Weaving my interlaced dreams
I've encountered your sincere embrace
Accompanying me through hardship
Weary and disheartened from奔波
On the road, another bend of纷扰 and setbacks
One day I think, think of returning but it's already late
I've encountered how many storms and upheavals
Weaving my interlaced dreams
I've encountered your sincere embrace
Accompanying me through hardship
Weary and disheartened from奔波
On the road, another bend of纷扰 and setbacks
One day I think, think of returning but it's already late
I've encountered how many storms and upheavals
Weaving my interlaced dreams
I've encountered your sincere embrace
Accompanying me through hardship
Weary and disheartened from奔波
On the road, another bend of纷扰 and setbacks
One day I think, think of returning but it's already late

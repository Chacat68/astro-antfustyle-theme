> Cantopop Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in the heart, sharing stories of popular or niche Hong Kong music.

Some songs can transcend language barriers and reach the softest corners of the heart. Kenshi Yonezu's "Lemon" is already a classic full of healing power, and when it meets the gentle rhythm of Cantonese, this stunning version is born.

"Not the Lyric God" carefully rewrote the lyrics, perfectly blending the original song's deep emotion with the charm of Cantonese, and cleverly incorporated Dayo Wong's classic clip from "Breaking the Hell." This is not just a language conversion, but an emotional sublimation—using the power of music to lead listeners out of life's hardships and confusion.

As the creator wished: "I hope this song can dispel curses for some friends. Rebirth, move forward!" This Cantonese version of "Lemon" carries warm wishes, lighting a lamp of hope for every soul stumbling along life's path.

Sitting down in the sunset
Even sitting down, how to speak freely
Looking back at those past days together
So beautiful, that tears bring a smile
Even if wanting to let go, how to let go
Warmth turned into scars
Still not used to, the heart suddenly
Feeling sad without knowing why
Even if dissecting yesterday
Can no longer have a conversation
No way to part with memories and tears
Pretending to be carefree
Even if this ending is heartbreaking
Irreversible deviation
Hard to learn how to bravely face
All the changes in the world
Who hasn't bid farewell before life ends
Who returns to dust and stirs up ashes
Some embraces can no longer be had
Finally becoming a brand

Some bitterness will trap you in darkness
Some sourness will lock you in confinement
Some losses make you feel hollowed out
For the rest of life, always missing someone
Some loves fade but always leave behind
The lingering fragrance of companionship seeping in
The rain hasn't stopped, if you're willing to wipe away tear stains
Sunny days will draw near
Everything encountered yesterday
Is for moving forward today

Even if wanting to ask, how to ask
Joy has already turned into regret
In the long night, the empty chair at home
Can never again be close to each other
Afraid of being alone, yet alone
Wounds have become gifts
Staying in that corner, wanting to escape
But unable to break free from this soft imprisonment
Who hasn't bid farewell before life ends
Who returns to dust and stirs up ashes
Some embraces can no longer be had
Finally becoming a brand

Some bitterness will trap you in darkness
Some sourness will lock you in confinement
Some losses make you feel hollowed out
For the rest of life, always missing someone
Some loves fade but always leave behind
The lingering fragrance of companionship seeping in
The rain hasn't stopped, if you're willing to wipe away tear stains
Sunny days will draw near
Everything encountered yesterday
Is for moving forward today

Departure ultimately cannot be avoided
A portrait shouldn't bind you
Countless moments that can be remembered
Grateful for the luck of having met
Once shared a second together
Perfect as if in a dream
Courage hatches within remembrance
Accept those farewells well

I breathed to seek myself
I ran to save my soul
This life, you and I
Were on a certain journey
A magnificent trip with no return
One day it will all fade, but can resonate with
The memories of how that person once lived
Yesterday stopped, if you're willing to wipe away tear stains
Tomorrow will draw near
All those stories encountered together
Distant yet vivid
Come on today, to dispel your curse
Able to be reborn and move forward

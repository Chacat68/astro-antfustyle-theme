Swing might break your stereotypes about Cantopop. This duo doesn’t lean on the conventional big ballads. Instead, they gravitate toward jazz, funk, and electronic textures. Their arrangements are full of small tricks and playful details; emotionally they avoid melodrama, often slipping in a touch of dark humor.

## “1984” (《1984》)

“1984” is one of Swing’s signature tracks. A retro electronic groove paired with an easy-to-hum melody—once it starts, you want to hum along. It feels familiar, but it isn’t as blunt as typical pop.

Lyrics: omitted.

## “Half-Page Flyer” (《半张飞》)

The beauty of “Half-Page Flyer” is that its playfulness never feels shallow. Swing wraps sharp-edged emotions in a light, nimble presentation: the melody is smooth, the imagery is cheeky, but the underlying force never lets go.

This is exactly why I like Swing. In their hands, a pop song isn’t a container for a single emotion; it’s closer to a short film—cuts, camera angles, sudden shifts. And every now and then, they tuck in a bit of dark humor where you least expect it. You laugh once, and after the laugh you’re back to the more serious question: why did that line sting?

Lyrics: omitted.

## “Empire State Building” (《帝國大廈》)

“Empire State Building” carries a strong sense of urban loneliness. Swing uses delicate arranging and layered harmonies to build an atmosphere that feels modern yet faintly nostalgic. The lyrics frame emotional struggle through the metaphor of competition: always feeling like the runner-up, wanting to be champion—only to realize that even if you win, you might still lose each other.

## Closing

Swing’s music feels like “experimental cinema inside Cantopop.” It isn’t made to pander, and it isn’t made to show off. In the gap between “pop” and “experiment,” you get both the pleasure of melody and the satisfaction of structural craft.

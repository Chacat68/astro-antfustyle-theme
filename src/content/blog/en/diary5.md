Recently, my work has been on pause. Suddenly, I find myself with a lot of freely distributable time in my life. Within the 24 hours of each day, I've started to seriously consider how every single hour should be spent.

Life has suddenly become very concrete. From morning till night, I record the things I want to do in Google Calendar. Random thoughts that pop into my head get jotted down in Flomo, and then I let them go.

After breakfast in the morning, I brew my favorite coffee, open a YouTube channel, and play a two-hour Pomodoro music track. Following the rhythm of the music, I strive to complete all my tasks. I'm relearning how to do one thing well—through thinking, planning, and execution—truly seeing a task through from start to finish, and then telling myself, "OK, done!"

I've reduced my attention to social media and news, spending only a little time each day on these two things, so that external information doesn't overly interfere with my life. I control the valve of information intake in my life, reserving more time for myself, my family, and friends, and focusing on living my own life well.

During this period, I enjoy going to the small supermarket at the entrance of my neighborhood to buy groceries and milk. I like the feeling of encountering strangers. The refrigerator at home is always stocked with ingredients that my family and friends enjoy. Occasionally, I invite them over to share a meal and chat about the little things in life.

Recently, I've turned on the PS5 again to continue Jin Sakai's journey, experiencing the difficulties and growth he encounters along the way. Doing what is difficult yet right is not easy; it's quite possible that no one understands you.

When the surrounding environment turns unfavorable, the only thing to do is to hold firm to your beliefs, choose your own path, and press forward diligently. Perhaps this is an opportunity to let go of certain obsessions and reconsider what is truly important in our lives. What problems exist in life? How can we solve them?

As for myself, at this point in time, I have begun the second decade of my life. I must think about what it is I truly want to pursue. Living a concrete, well-lived life—let's strive to get through the winter and wait for the warmth of spring. May we all be there!

> Chinese Collection: Documenting the Chinese music that accompanied our growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

Some songs can strike right at the heart, and Wu Bai's "Passive" is one of them.

"The longer I love you, the more passive I become"—this lyric captures the most genuine contradiction in love. When we face someone we truly love deeply, we often become overly cautious because we cherish them too much, choosing to retreat rather than take the initiative.

Wu Bai's signature raspy voice adds a unique texture to this song. Every note carries the marks of time, and every line feels like a sincere confession flowing from the depths of the heart. This is not just a song; it's a mirror that shows us our truest selves in love.

I recommend "Passive" because it uses the simplest language to interpret complex emotions. In this ever-changing world, finding a song that truly touches the heart is, in itself, a kind of happiness.

I can go a long time without contacting you
Letting the days pass by like this
Keeping myself busy can serve as an excuse
To escape the various weaknesses of missing you
I can learn to be very cold towards you
Why can't I learn to take back this love
Facing you is my greatest torment
All these years, I've never said it to you

The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because your love has no fixed abode
It's you who made my heart slowly retreat
Retreat to a corner you cannot see
The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because my love is no longer spent on you
It's me who made my heart lose its freedom
Yet I no longer have the courage to indulge

I can go a long time without contacting you
Letting the days pass by like this
Keeping myself busy can serve as an excuse
To escape the various weaknesses of missing you
I can learn to be very cold towards you
Why can't I learn to take back this love
Facing you is my greatest torment
All these years, I've never said it to you

The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because your love has no fixed abode
It's you who made my heart slowly retreat
Retreat to a corner you cannot see
The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because my love is no longer spent on you
It's me who made my heart lose its freedom
Yet I no longer have the courage to indulge

The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because your love has no fixed abode
It's you who made my heart slowly retreat
Retreat to a corner you cannot see
The longer I love you, the more passive I become
Only because my love is no longer spent on you
It's me who made my heart lose its freedom
Yet I no longer have the courage to indulge

No courage to indulge

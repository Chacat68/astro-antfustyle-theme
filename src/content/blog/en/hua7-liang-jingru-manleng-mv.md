> Chinese Pop Collection: Documenting the Chinese pop music that accompanied our growth, sharing melodies and lyrics that touch the heart.

Upon first hearing "Slow to Cool," I was drawn to its "restrained tenderness": unlike love songs that burst forth instantly, it tucks passion into the heart amidst the slow flow of time, allowing emotions and stories to gradually warm up. Fish Leong's voice remains soft and gentle, yet reveals greater maturity in its control and release, as if leaving behind a melody for all those in need of self-healing to dwell within.

This official MV uses a tonal shift "from cool to warm" to tell a story about the difficulty of self-expression, misunderstandings with family, and eventual reconciliation. The professional details of the barbershop, the distance and closeness between people, are all presented with restrained cinematography: the visuals first create a sense of distance, then gradually draw closer in reconciliation, allowing viewers to see that the power of gentleness is not clamor, but choice and trust.

Looking at the song's structure, the emotional build-up in the chorus is not rushed. The melody juxtaposes the theme of "slow to cool" with the hope of "slow to warm," lifting the listener from a low point. Yao Ruolong's lyrics and Xiao Huangqi's music have always excelled at giving everyday emotions a poetic outlet, and this time is no exception—you can clearly trace the path of "silence, misunderstanding, reconciliation" within the lyrics.

## Reasons for Recommendation

- **Restrained expression makes for more enduring listening:** Neither the melody nor the emotions are "forced," allowing empathy to occur almost imperceptibly.
- **Narrative tension in the visuals:** The color shift from muted to clear, combined with close-up performances and lifelike details, enhances a sense of realism.
- **A love song for adults:** It narrates the process of "expression—misunderstanding—reconciliation" in intimate relationships, aligning more closely with real-life experiences.

## Lyrics

**Verse 1**  
If it's not love, don't lie, just a little fondness  
If it's not hate, don't linger, don't pretend to sigh  
Who truly takes whom seriously, who aches for whom  
Who is whose only one, who truly takes whom seriously  

**Chorus**  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later  

**Verse 2**  
If it's not love, don't lie, just a little fondness  
If it's not hate, don't linger, don't pretend to sigh  
Who truly takes whom seriously, who aches for whom  
Who is whose only one, who truly takes whom seriously  

**Chorus (Repeat)**  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later  

**Bridge**  
Perhaps one day, you'll finally discover  
The one who truly loves you, guarding sorrow alone  

**Chorus (Final)**  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later  
Those slow to cool, they torment themselves  
Those slow to cool, their tears always come later

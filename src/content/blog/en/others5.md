description: "Steve Jobs''s commencement speech at Stanford University, where he shared three stories from his life: about connecting the dots, about love and loss, and about death. He encouraged everyone to believe that these dots will somehow connect in the future; to find what you love and never settle; and to remember that you are going to die, which is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose."

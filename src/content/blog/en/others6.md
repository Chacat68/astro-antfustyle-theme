description: "This poem is widely circulated online as being by Charlie Chaplin, but this has not been confirmed, and multiple versions exist. Some research suggests the original authors were Kim and Alison McMillen. The original poem was translated into Portuguese, and that Portuguese translation was later translated back into English, after which it was rumored to be Chaplin's work. Regardless of the facts, please remember to love yourself well!"

## Transcript

As I began to love myself

I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.

Today, I know, this is

"AUTHENTICITY".

When I truly began to love myself,
I realized that all pain and emotional torment
were merely reminders: to live without betraying my own heart.
Today I understand, this is called
'Authenticity'.

As I began to love myself

I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person,

even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it,

and even though this person was me.

Today I call it

"RESPECT".

When I truly began to love myself,
I learned how rude it is to impose my wishes on others,
even when I knew the timing wasn't right,
and the person wasn't ready,
even if that person was myself.
Today I understand, this is called
'Respect'.

As I began to love myself

I stopped craving for a different life,

and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow.

Today I call it

"MATURITY".

When I began to love myself,
I stopped craving a different life,
and I could see that everything happening around me
was an invitation for me to grow.
Now, I call it
'Maturity'.

As I began to love myself

I understood that at any circumstance,

I am in the right place at the right time,

and everything happens at the exactly right moment,

so I could be calm.

Today I call it

"SELF-CONFIDENCE".

When I truly began to love myself,
I understood that I have always been
in the right place, at the right time, and everything happened just as it should.
Thus, I found peace.
Today I understand, this is called
'Self-Confidence'.

As I began to love myself

I quit steeling my own time,

and I stopped designing huge projects for the future.

Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness,

things I love to do and that make my heart cheer,

and I do them in my own way

and in my own rhythm.

Today I call it

"HONESTY".

When I truly began to love myself,
I stopped sacrificing my free time,
and I stopped sketching grand plans for tomorrow.
Today I only do what is fun and joyful,
things I love that make my heart sing,
in my own way, at my own rhythm.
Today I understand, this is called
'Simplicity'.

As I began to love myself

I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health –

food, people, things, situations,

and everything that drew me down and away from myself.

At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.

Today I know it is

"LOVE OF ONESELF".

When I truly began to love myself,
I started distancing myself from anything unhealthy.
Whether it was food, people, things, or situations,
I stepped away from anything that pulled me away from my true self.
I used to call this "pursuing healthy selfishness,"
but today I understand, this is
'Self-Love'.

As I began to love myself

I quit trying to always be right,

and ever since I was wrong less of the time.

Today I discovered that is

"MODESTY".

When I truly began to love myself,
I stopped always trying to be right and avoid mistakes.
Today I understand, this is called
'Humility'.

As I began to love myself

I refused to go on living in the past

and worry about the future.

Now, I only live for the moment,

where EVERYTHING is happening.

Today I live each day, day by day,

and I call it

"PERFECTION".

When I truly began to love myself,
I stopped dwelling on the past,
and I stopped worrying about tomorrow.
Now, I live only in the present moment,
where EVERYTHING is happening.
Today, I live here and now,
day by day. This is called
'Perfection'.

As I began to love myself

I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick.

But as I connected it to my heart,

my mind became a valuable ally.

Today I call this connection

WISDOM OF THE HEART.

When I truly began to love myself,
I understood that my thoughts could impoverish and sicken me,
but when I awakened the power of my heart,
reason became an important partner.
This combination I call,
'Wisdom of the Heart'.

We no longer need to fear arguments,

confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.

Even stars collide,

and out of their crashing new worlds are born.

Today I know

That is LIFE!

We no longer need to fear disagreements,
conflicts, or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.
For even stars sometimes collide,
and from their collisions, new worlds are born.
Today I understand, this is
'Life'!

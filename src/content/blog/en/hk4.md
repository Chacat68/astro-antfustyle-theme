> Cantopop Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in my heart, sharing stories of popular or niche Cantopop.

## Preface

In the dazzling galaxy of the Hong Kong music scene, Miriam Yeung shines like a unique star, illuminating the youth of countless people with her hearty laughter and sincere singing voice. From a sunny girl to a mature woman, her musical journey not only documents her own growth but also accompanies us through the joys and sorrows of life.

Her creative partnership with Wyman Wong is a perfect match. From "Wild Child" to "Too Bad I'm an Aquarius," each song is like a love letter to time, telling stories of love, friendship, and growth. As a fan who has been listening to her songs since adolescence, I have witnessed her transformation and perseverance, and found resonance and solace in her voice.

This article is my tribute to the musical career of this "Laughing Girl" and a gentle look back at my own youthful memories.

**"A Maiden's Prayer"**

This song was my first impression of Ms. Yeung. At the time, she projected the image of a sunny young girl, and I was deeply impressed by this girl on the album cover who loved to laugh so much. The youthful, girlish aura she exuded in the later MV was just like my classmates of the same age.

I started paying attention to her with this song, but I truly began to love her music starting with "Wild Child." The cover of this album features purple, Miriam's favorite color and her lucky color. In the limited edition, Miriam personally drew cartoon characters and "不倒花" (tumbler flowers). She hoped her songs could last as long as these tumbler flowers.

This song was written for Miriam by Wyman Wong, a testament to their friendship. Fans often say that Wyman saved his best songs for Miriam. They debuted and grew up together, had a falling out midway, but reconciled with a hug ten years later at the YY Concert. As a fan who has accompanied their growth all along, I was deeply moved and happy for them!

Wyman Wong wrote the song "The Best Debt," pouring his desire for reconciliation into the lyrics. Miriam also thanked the lyricist for the great work during her concert. After their "century hug," they reconciled.

On Victoria Peak in Hong Kong, there is a road called "Findlay Road." "Findlay" sounds like "分離" (separation) in Cantonese. "On Findlay Road" tells a story of separation in a relationship, depicting the difficulty of building and maintaining love. Paired with Miriam's soft singing, it feels like you're taking a walk on Victoria Peak, witnessing this love story unfold, sighing at the hardship of maintaining love, just as the lyrics sing: How can it be made to last a lifetime? So few couples manage it.

Finally, ending with the song that best represents Ms. Yeung, "Too Bad I'm an Aquarius."

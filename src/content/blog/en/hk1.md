> Hong Kong Music Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs intertwined with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in the heart, sharing stories of Hong Kong music, whether popular or niche.

### Opening

The idea to write this article came after the release of the song "世界真细小" ("The World Is So Small"). I wanted to talk about C.Y.KONG, one of my personal favorite Hong Kong musicians.

> Introduction: C.Y. Kong, pronounced "Si Wai Jiang," is the pen name of Hong Kong musician Kong Chi-yan. He also has an alias, Yamamoto Yota. He is primarily involved in composition, arrangement, and production, occasionally writing lyrics as well. He is an all-around musician and a crucial behind-the-scenes figure (composer, arranger, producer) for Faye Wong, Leslie Cheung, and Eason Chan. His works (compositions, arrangements) often feature strong British or electronic elements, excelling in avant-garde, psychedelic, and dark styles that highlight his distinctive personal touch. They are not overly commercialized and possess high recognizability. Songs he arranges place high demands on the singer's vocal skills; singers with weaker abilities may struggle to handle his style and risk ruining the performance.

### Reunion in "The World Is So Small"

"The World Is So Small" was originally a Cantonese children's song, but it is used here to describe the reunion of two people after separation. When they meet by chance, they can't help but experience inner changes, and their story replays in their hearts.

This song was co-created by C.Y.KONG and Jean Chien, depicting the current state of their marriage—these former lovers are now separated.

**Lyrics:**

為何上天选今日 沒防備的這一日
共前度分開多久 偏碰見於这日
沒攜著妻子一日 沒乘坐跑車一日
如何能給你印象 成就大過昨日
想過早晚會會合 不過此際變事實
都會驚慌失惜 似行刑受罰

### Meeting and Understanding in "Sisters"

C.Y.Kong and Jean Chien got married in 2001. That year, C.Y.Kong expressed his feelings through music, personally composing a song for his wife, with lyrics penned by Lin Xi, titled "Sisters." Miriam Yeung performed this song, expressing her joy and emotions for her good sister Jean Chien entering the church.

> I chose the famous scene from Miriam Yeung's "All Extremes Come Together Concert" live version where she cried uncontrollably.

**Lyrics:**

听过你太多心事
但已经不再重要
眼见你快做新娘
做蜜友的真想撒娇
我与你太好姊妹
为你竟哭了又笑
时装都弃掉 穿一世婚纱算了
唯求好姊妹 抱我一抱

### Separation in "Paper Marriage"

The couple divorced in 2007, and "Paper Marriage," composed by Jean Chien with arrangement by C.Y.Kong, marks the passage of this relationship. Now, the two have joined forces again to create "The World Is So Small," which feels quite remarkable.

**Lyrics:**

何时建起了 几道围墙
这一头家 本来非这样
尝试穿过 透明屏障
发觉你 人在心不在场
逐渐丧失 亲密磁场
有盏红灯 凄然的发亮
而你彷似正怀疑你
来年同行伴侣 并未达理想
想扮成 无事故 岁月如常
但我知 其实你 不想
再对著我 抱著我 亲密如常
去年还 承诺过 贫穷和病塌
都奉陪 陪著我 上路离场
但那些 其实纸一张
以爱情来 填满的
用年华 维系的
纵是银或金或张白纸
依然完全没保障

## Preface

> "The meaning of life is to eat a little better."

Today, we have lost a true artist of life. The passing of Mr. Cai Lan has left a unique voice missing from the entire Chinese-speaking cultural sphere—that old imp who always used the simplest language to convey the most profound truths about life. He was not just a food critic, writer, or filmmaker; he was a philosopher of life, interpreting what it means to "live an interesting life" in his own way.

In this fast-paced era, Mr. Cai Lan always maintained a rare composure and elegance. He taught us that life doesn't have to be so tense, food doesn't have to be so complicated, and the most important thing in life is to keep a sense of curiosity and a genuine character. Today, let us look back together at the precious legacy this legendary figure has left us.

## The Life Philosophy of a Food Critic

Mr. Cai Lan was best known as a food critic, but he was never the kind of aloof gourmet commentator. In his writing, food was never a tool for showing off but a seasoning for life. He once said, "The best food is often found in the most inconspicuous places."

### From Street Food to the Great Way of Life

I remember he once wrote an article about Hong Kong-style milk tea in a cha chaan teng. In just a few hundred words, he managed to convey the essence of life. He didn't use flowery language to describe food; instead, he used the plainest words to tell the stories and emotions behind it. A simple bowl of wonton noodles, in his description, became an emotional bridge connecting the past and present, hometown and foreign lands.

He often said, "Eating is not just about filling the stomach; it's about filling the soul." This statement captures his understanding of food—that it is a carrier of culture, an expression of emotion, and an art of living.

### Simplicity Is Beauty

What moved me most in Mr. Cai Lan's food philosophy was his advocacy for "simplicity." In an era that pursues complexity and novelty, he consistently believed that the best flavors often come from the simplest ingredients and the most straightforward cooking methods.

He once said, "A good chef can make the most delicious dishes with the simplest ingredients. A person who understands life can savor the deepest flavors from the most ordinary days." This is not just an understanding of food but also an insight into life.

## Life Wisdom in Words

Beyond food, Mr. Cai Lan's writing was also a unique landscape. His essays lacked ornate language and profound theories, yet they always revealed truth in simplicity and philosophy in humor.

### The Attitude of an Old Imp

Mr. Cai Lan often called himself an "old imp," a nickname that perfectly summarized his attitude toward life. Even in his later years, he maintained a youthful heart, full of curiosity about the world and passion for life.

He wrote in one of his articles, "Life is short; why make yourself so tired? Eat when it's time to eat, play when it's time to play, sleep when it's time to sleep." This seemingly casual attitude actually contains profound life wisdom—in our limited lives, we should learn to enjoy the present and cherish what is before us.

### The Value of Authenticity

In an increasingly hypocritical world, Mr. Cai Lan's authenticity was especially precious. He never concealed his preferences, never pandered to so-called mainstream values, and always maintained his independent thinking and judgment.

He once said, "The most important thing in life is sincerity—to oneself and to others. A hypocritical life is like a dish without seasoning: bland and tasteless." This sincerity was reflected not only in his writing but also in his attitude toward life.

## The Artistic Pursuit of a Filmmaker

Many may not know that Mr. Cai Lan was also a seasoned filmmaker. He participated in the production of many classic Hong Kong films and collaborated with superstars like Jackie Chan and Stephen Chow. In an industry filled with commercialism, he always maintained his pursuit of art and insistence on quality.

### Humanistic Care in Entertainment

The films Mr. Cai Lan worked on often contained deep humanistic care within their entertainment value. He believed that film should not just be a tool for entertainment but also a vehicle for conveying values and life wisdom. This philosophy was well reflected in the movies he helped produce.

He once said, "A good film should make the audience think while laughing and grow while being entertained." This understanding of film art reflects his sense of responsibility and mission as a cultural figure.

## An Artist of Life

If I had to use one phrase to summarize Mr. Cai Lan, I think "artist of life" would be the most fitting. He turned life into art and the ordinary into poetry.

### An Advocate of Slow Living

In this fast-paced era, Mr. Cai Lan was a steadfast advocate of slow living. He taught us that life should not be a race but a stroll. We should learn to pause, to feel the beauty in life, and to savor the little moments.

He often said, "What's the rush? If the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up." This open-minded attitude allowed him to maintain inner peace and happiness in any environment.

### Cross-Disciplinary Talent

Mr. Cai Lan was a true cross-disciplinary talent. He excelled in multiple fields, including food, literature, film, and television. This versatility stemmed from his love for life and thirst for knowledge.

He once said, "Life is like a sumptuous banquet; every dish is worth tasting." This pursuit of a diverse life made his own journey exceptionally rich and colorful.

## Legacy and Influence

Mr. Cai Lan's passing marks the end of an era. However, the spiritual wealth he left behind will continue to influence generations to come.

### The Inheritance of a Life Philosophy

Mr. Cai Lan's greatest contribution was not how many books he wrote or films he made but how he used his own way of life to show us what it means to "live an interesting life." He taught us that life can be simple but must not lack fun; life can be ordinary but must not lack passion.

This life philosophy is especially precious in today's anxious times. We need to learn to maintain a calm heart and enjoy the small joys of life, just as Mr. Cai Lan did.

### Upholding Cultural Values

Amid the wave of globalization, Mr. Cai Lan always upheld the traditional values of Chinese culture. In his own way, he inherited and promoted Chinese culinary culture, literary traditions, and humanistic spirit.

He once said, "Culture is not something lofty and distant; it is integrated into the little details of life." This understanding and commitment to culture made him an important inheritor of Chinese culture.

## Cai Lan Forever

Although Mr. Cai Lan has left us, his spirit will live on in our hearts. Whenever we savor food, read words, or ponder life, we will remember this lovable old imp.

He taught us not just how to appreciate food but how to appreciate life. He showed us that the meaning of life lies not in pursuing great achievements but in discovering beauty in the ordinary and finding joy in simplicity.

### The Best Tribute

The best tribute to Mr. Cai Lan is not sorrow and tears but inheriting his attitude toward life: learning to enjoy life, maintaining authenticity, and being an interesting person.

As he often said during his lifetime, "Life is short; live a little happier." Let us carry this happiness and open-mindedness as we continue on our own life paths.

## Conclusion

Mr. Cai Lan is gone, but what he left behind is not just words and works but an attitude toward life and wisdom for living. In this restless era, we need his unhurried way of life and his philosophy of treating others with sincerity even more.

Let us remember his words: "The true flavor of life lies in simple joys." In ordinary days, seek the true taste of life; in busy lives, maintain inner tranquility and joy. This is perhaps the most important life wisdom Mr. Cai Lan wanted to pass on to us.

May Mr. Cai Lan rest in peace. May he, in another world, still taste the most delicious food, write the most interesting words, and live the happiest life.

> Cantopop Collection: Recounting those eras of Cantonese songs interwoven with light and shadow, recording unforgettable melodies in the heart, sharing stories of popular or niche Hong Kong music.

## Preface

There are moments when we feel we have lost so much: beloved places, cherished things, and one, then another, beloved person. When life's burdens weigh us down until we can barely breathe, when darkness seems about to swallow all hope, music becomes a haven for our souls.

This Cantonese version of "Once I Thought About Ending It All" soothed the sadness within me in the gentlest way, offering the most precious hope during those difficult days.

## Song Background

"Once I Thought About Ending It All" was originally a song that deeply reflects on the meaning of life, and this Cantonese version was born under special historical circumstances. The creator wrote in the song description: "I don't want to lose anymore, so I wrote this Cantonese version of 'Once I Thought About Ending It All' for you."

This is not merely a simple language conversion, but a reinterpretation of emotion. The rhythm and emotional expression of Cantonese give this song a different warmth and texture.

## Lyrics

When you think of leaving it all behind, jumping from a high place
Do you feel there are cold, mocking eyes, despising you, right?
But acting rashly comes at a cost
Breaking the hearts of loved ones, I fear
Apologizing in the next life is too late, regretful, right?

When you cry, do you always think of letting go, giving up?
Does despair fill your mind, exploding everywhere, hurting you, right?
Don't let go and fall into ruins, look back at those you love once
I hope you can stand strong again, filled with courage, don't be afraid

Watered by pain, you grow stronger
After the rain, the heart opens wide, this depression will surely lift
Returning home, you'll drink the bowl of warm soup you longed for
With both arms, create, ignite passion with your ideals once more
Ordinary iron transforms through will, tempered by countless trials into finest steel
This world is too beautiful, don't let go with both hands lightly
Hold on, hold on, to the distant horizon

With both hands, found starlight deep in the vast sky
Though the world holds malice, love also blooms abundantly
Forget the wounds, look ahead
Tomorrow will surely be clear
Carry faith with you, even if both arms ache, never let go—

When you're very lonely, do you want to find someone to talk to?
But always feel everyone seems to dislike you, right?
Don't let your heart harden again
Regrets can then be digested
With an open mind, you'll see farther, more magnificent, right?

When your sadness overflows, flooding into your scars
Thoughts of giving up, almost full, about to snap, right?
Don't let go and fall into ruins, look back at those you love once
I hope you can stand strong again, filled with courage, don't be afraid

Even if storms descend, fight against them with all your might
After the rain, the heart opens wide, this depression will surely lift
Returning home, you'll drink the bowl of warm soup you longed for
With both arms, create, ignite passion with reason once more
Ordinary iron transforms through will, tempered by countless trials into finest steel
This world is too beautiful, don't let go with both hands lightly
Able to hold on, face calamities with a smile, gaze toward the horizon

Rebuild this battered and scarred place, await the light of dawn
Though the world holds malice, love also blooms abundantly
Forget the wounds, look ahead
Tomorrow will surely be clear
That faith, carry it with you
Even if both arms ache, never let go

In this life, this flower can only bloom once
How can there be an end to it all, when there are loved ones who miss you
Even in dire straits, resist decay, struggle with all your might
Hoping to stand strong, refilled with courage, never fear again

From within pain and darkness, found hope
Though the world holds malice, love also blooms abundantly
Forget the wounds, look ahead
Tomorrow will surely be clear
Carry faith with you, even if both arms ache, never let go

Having tasted bitterness, you grow more robust
Ignite yourself, shine your light
Faith will overcome setbacks, never, ever let go!

## Conclusion

Cantonese lyrics always resonate most deeply within me, and I hope this song can be heard by more people. If you are also in a dark period of life, I hope this song can heal you.

Give yourself some time. In this increasingly uncertain world, nothing is absolutely correct or absolutely necessary. Experience the beauty of life, live well, and keep striving to live on.

Promise me, let's live on together, okay?
